<h3 class="chapterTitle">Product description</h3>
<ProductDescription>The Aeon Labs Micro Energy Switch is a low-cost Z-Wave appliance switch specifically used to enable Z-Wave command and control (on/off) for existing in-wall switches. 
The wireless module is powered from the mains supply and is a three-wire design which requires a neutral connection. In the event of power failure, 
non-volatile memory retains all programmed information relating to the units operating status.
</ProductDescription><h3 class="chapterTitle">Installation Guidelines</h3>
<Installation>
<p>The device is designed for a 3 wire system which requires a neutral connection. The module is powered from the main supply.</p>
<p>The schematic below shows how to wire the actuator. The power supply and the appliance are connected by the Load, Power Input and Neutral connectors.
The 3.3 Volt and External Switch connectors are for external switching.
</p>
<p align="center"> <img src="img/AEO/AEO_MEI/AEO_MEI.en.png" width="450" align="center"></p>
<p>After the electrical installation the device has to be implemented in the Z-Wave Network.</p>
</Installation><h3 class="chapterTitle">Behavior within the Z-Wave network</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">I</span> On factory default the device does not belong to any Z-Wave network. The device needs to join an existing 
		wireless network to communicate with the devices of this network. This process is called <b>Inclusion</b>. 
		Devices can also leave a network. This process is called  <b>Exclusion</b>. Both processes are initiated by the 
		primary controller of the Z-Wave network. This controller will be turned into exclusion respective inclusion mode. 
		Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion or exclusion mode. 
		Only if the primary controller is in inclusion or exclusion mode, this device can join or leave the network. 
		Leaving the network - i.e. being excluded - sets the device back to factory default.</p>
		<p>If the device already belongs to a network, follow the exclusion process before including it in your network.
		Otherwise inclusion of this device will fail. If the controller being included was a primary controller, it has to be reset 
		first.  
		</p>
		
		</content><InclusionExclusion>
To include the Aeon Labs Micro Switch with your Z-Wave controller simple bring it in the inclusion-mode and click the Inclusion/Exclusion button at the Aeon Labs Micro Switch once.
Alternatively you can use the external switch by quickly pressing it six times. If the Aeon Labs Micro Switch was successfully included to a Z-Wave network, the Status Indication LED will
either be solid on or off (depending on if the switch is on or off) 10 seconds after the button was last pressed.
</InclusionExclusion><h3 class="chapterTitle">Operating the device</h3>
<Usage>
<p>The switch is operated by an external switch/button or wireless. The click sets the switch on or off.</p>
</Usage><h3 class="chapterTitle">Node Information Frame</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">NI</span> The Node Information Frame is the business card of a Z-Wave device. It contains information about the device type and the technical
		capabilities. The inclusion and exclusion of the device is confirmed by sending out a Node Information Frame.  Beside this
		it may be needed for certain network operations to send out a Node Information Frame. </p>
		</content><NIF>
<p>A single click at the Inclusion/Exclusion switch sends a Node Information Frame.</p>
</NIF><h3 class="chapterTitle">LED Control</h3>
<LEDControl>
	<ul>
	<li>The LED on the Micro Switch will blink if it is currently not paired into a Z-Wave network.</li>
	<li> If the Aeon Labs Micro Switch was successfully included to a Z-Wave network, the Status Indication LED will either be solid on or off 
	(depending on if the switch is on or off) 10 seconds after the button was pressed. </li>
	</ul>
</LEDControl><h3 class="chapterTitle">Associations</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">A</span> Z-Wave devices control other Z-Wave devices. The relationship between one device controlling another device is 
		called <i>association</i>. In order to control a different device, the controlling device needs to maintain a list of 
		devices that will receive controlling commands. These lists are called <b> association groups </b> and they are always 
		related to certain events (e.g. button pressed, sensor triggers, ...). In case the event happens all devices stored
		in the respective association group will receive a common wireless command. </p>
