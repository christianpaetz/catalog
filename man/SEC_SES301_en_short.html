<ProductDescription>
<p>The SEC_SES301 is a battery operated device which acts as temperature sensor. It uses Z-Wave wireless 
commands to send its temperature data to a controller. The device is IP 30 rated and can therefore 
be used in dry environments only. The precision of the temperature sensor is +/- 0.5 degree.
</p>
<p> Features include </p>
<ul>
<li>Can be configured to report on change in temperature or at set intervals</li>
<li>The value of change that trigger reports is configurable in 0.1˚C steps from 0.1˚C to 10˚C</li>
<li>Temperature and battery level alarms can be sent to up to 4 separate devices</li>
<li>Temperature reports can be configured to be in either Celsius or Fahrenheit</li>
</ul>
</ProductDescription><h3 class="chapterTitle">Installation Guidelines</h3>
<Installation>
<img src="img/SEC/SEC_SES301_1.png" width="300" align="middle">
<p>
Choose the position where the unit is to be mounted. Avoid locations alongside or behind large metal
surfaces that could interfere with the low-power radio signals between the unit and the Controller.
</p>
<p>
The SES301 should be mounted on an internal wall, around 1.5 m above floor level and in a position away from draughts, direct heat and sunlight.
</p>
<p>
Make sure that there will be sufficient space around the unit to allow easy access to the two retaining screws on the base of the wall plate.
</p>
</Installation><h3 class="chapterTitle">Behavior within the Z-Wave network</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">I</span> On factory default the device does not belong to any Z-Wave network. The device needs to join an existing 
		wireless network to communicate with the devices of this network. This process is called <b>Inclusion</b>. 
		Devices can also leave a network. This process is called  <b>Exclusion</b>. Both processes are initiated by the 
		primary controller of the Z-Wave network. This controller will be turned into exclusion respective inclusion mode. 
		Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion or exclusion mode. 
		Only if the primary controller is in inclusion or exclusion mode, this device can join or leave the network. 
		Leaving the network - i.e. being excluded - sets the device back to factory default.</p>
		<p>If the device already belongs to a network, follow the exclusion process before including it in your network.
		Otherwise inclusion of this device will fail. If the controller being included was a primary controller, it has to be reset 
		first.  
		</p>
		
		</content><InclusionExclusion>
<p> Pushing the Button near the battery for two seconds confirms inclusion and exclusion. </p>
</InclusionExclusion><h3 class="chapterTitle">Operating the device</h3>
<Usage>
<p>The temperature sensor (communication pattern 3) can be used without further installation and configuration work.</p>
</Usage><h3 class="chapterTitle">Wakeup Intervals - how to communicate with the device?</h3>
<content>
 		<p><span class="icon_white">W</span> This device is battery operated and turned into deep sleep state most of the time to save battery life time.  
 		Communication with the device is limited. In order to communicate with the device, a static controller <b>C</b>
 		is needed in the network. This controller will maintain a mailbox for the battery operated devices and store 
 		commands that can not be received during deep sleep state.
		Without such a controller, communication may become impossible and/or the battery life time is significantly decreased. </p>
		<p>This device will wakeup regularly and announce the wakeup state by sending out a so called Wakeup Notification.
		The controller can then empty the mailbox. Therefore, the device needs to be configured with the desired wakeup 
		interval and the node ID of the controller. If the device was included by a static controller this 
		controller will usually perform all necessary configurations. The wakeup interval is a tradeoff between maximal 
		battery life time and the desired responses of the device. </p>
		</content><Wakeup>
<p>	Pushing the Button near the battery for two seconds wakes up the device. </p>
</Wakeup><small><procontent>
		<p>It is possible to set the node ID to 255 to send wakeup notifications as broadcast. In this mode device takes more time to go 
		to sleep and drains battery faster, but can notify all it's direct neighbors about a wakeup. </p>
		</procontent></small><h3 class="chapterTitle">Node Information Frame</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">NI</span> The Node Information Frame is the business card of a Z-Wave device. It contains information about the device type and the technical
		capabilities. The inclusion and exclusion of the device is confirmed by sending out a Node Information Frame.  Beside this
		it may be needed for certain network operations to send out a Node Information Frame. </p>
		</content><NIF>
<p> Pushing the Button near the battery for two seconds issues a Node Information Frame. </p>
</NIF><h3 class="chapterTitle">Associations</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">A</span> Z-Wave devices control other Z-Wave devices. The relationship between one device controlling another device is 
		called <i>association</i>. In order to control a different device, the controlling device needs to maintain a list of 
		devices that will receive controlling commands. These lists are called <b> association groups </b> and they are always 
		related to certain events (e.g. button pressed, sensor triggers, ...). In case the event happens all devices stored
		in the respective association group will receive a common wireless command. </p>			
		<p>Association Groups:</p>
		</content><p><table class="associations">
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Nodes to receive unsolicited multilevel sensor report
			(max. nodes in group: 4)
		</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Nodes to receive unsolicited low battery warnings report
			(max. nodes in group: 4)
		</td>
</tr>
</table></p>

<h3 class="chapterTitle">Configuration Parameters</h3>
<content>
		<p>Z-Wave products are supposed to work out of the box after inclusion, however certain configuration can adapt the 
		function better to user needs or unlock further enhanced features.</p>
		<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Controllers may only allow to configure signed values. In order to set values in the range 128 … 255 the value 
		sent in the application shall be the desired value minus 256. For example: to set a parameter to 200  it may be needed to set 
		a value of 200 minus 256 =  minus 56. In case of two byte value the same logic applies: Values greater than 32768 may 
		needed to be given as negative values too.</p>
