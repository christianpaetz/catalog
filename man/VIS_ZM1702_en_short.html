<ProductDescription>
<p>The ZM1702 is a Z-Wave controllable door lock that fits into standard European doors. 
The mechanics can be adopted to right or left opening doors. The door lock can be applied for 
doors from a thickness of 38 mm and up. Since the lock is just a single dead bold lock it 
will not replace modern three dead bold locking outer doors. The door can be locked and 
unlocked using the inner side turn piece and/or the key pad. The wireless control allows 
to lock/unlock the lock, set/unset up to 15 different key codes (4...8 key long) and to 
limit the validity of certain key code.
</p>
<p> Note: The distance between the center of the handle axle and the center of the key 
insert is 88 mm. If the lock shall be used to retrofit an existing door, the original handle
lock distance needs ot be similar.

</Installation><h3 class="chapterTitle">Behavior within the Z-Wave network</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">I</span> On factory default the device does not belong to any Z-Wave network. The device needs to join an existing 
		wireless network to communicate with the devices of this network. This process is called <b>Inclusion</b>. 
		Devices can also leave a network. This process is called  <b>Exclusion</b>. Both processes are initiated by the 
		primary controller of the Z-Wave network. This controller will be turned into exclusion respective inclusion mode. 
		Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion or exclusion mode. 
		Only if the primary controller is in inclusion or exclusion mode, this device can join or leave the network. 
		Leaving the network - i.e. being excluded - sets the device back to factory default.</p>
		<p>If the device already belongs to a network, follow the exclusion process before including it in your network.
		Otherwise inclusion of this device will fail. If the controller being included was a primary controller, it has to be reset 
		first.  
		</p>
		
		</content><InclusionExclusion>
<p>To confirm Inclusion and Exclusion insert the following Key sequence on the key 
pad: 'C' + '8' + '8' + '8' followed by turning the handle on the inside of the door lock.
The operation is confirmed by a long beep.</p>
