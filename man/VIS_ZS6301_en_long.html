<h3 class="chapterTitle">What is Z-Wave?</h3>
<content>
			<p>This device is equipped with wireless communication complying to the Z-Wave standard. 
			Z-Wave is the <b>international standard for wireless communication</b> in smart homes and buildings. 
			It is using the <b>frequency of 868.42 MHz</b> to realize a very stable and secure communication. 
			Each message is reconfirmed (<b>two-way communication</b>) and every mains powered node can act as a 
			repeater for other nodes (<b>meshed network</b>) in case the receiver is not in direct wireless 
			range of the transmitter.</p>
			
			<p>Z-Wave differentiates between Controllers and Slaves. Slaves are either sensors 
			<b>(S)</b> transmitting metered or measured data or actuators <b>(A)</b> capable to execute an action.
			Controllers are either static mains powered controllers <b>(C)</b> also referred to as gateways or mobile battery
			operated remote controls <b>(R)</b>.
			This results in a number of possible communication patterns within a Z-Wave network that are  partly 
			or completely supported by a specific device.</p>
			<img src="img/zoverview.png" width="250" align="right">
			<ol>
			<li> Controllers control actuators </li>
			<li> Actuators report change of status back to controller </li>
			<li> Sensors report change of status of measured values to controller </li>
			<li> Sensors directly control actuators </li>
			<li> Actuators control other actuators </li>
			<li> Remote controls send signals to static controllers to trigger scenes or other actions </li>	
			<li> Remote controls control other actuators. </li>			
			</ol>
 		</content><small><procontent>
		<p>There are two different role a controller can have. There is always one single primary controller that is managing
		the network and including/excluding devices. The controller may have other functions - like control buttons - as well.
		All other controllers don't manage the network itself but can control other devices. They are called secondary controllers.
		The image also shows that its not possible to operate a sensor just from a remote control. Sensors only communicate
		with static controllers.</p>

<ProductDescription>
<p> Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a tasteless, invisible but very poisonous gas created among others by incomplete 
burning of burnable material or gas. This device is measuring the CO concentration in the air and issues an 
alarm when a certain level of CO is exceeded. The device will send an alarm when one of the following conditions are met:
</p>
<ul>
<li>50 ppm for 60 minutes</li>
<li>100 ppm for 10 minute</li>
<li>300 ppm for 3 minutés</li>
</ul>
<p>
Additionally a remote device can be switched. This can be an actuator e.g. opening a door or another 
alarm device such a siren. The device consists of a mounting base that is screwed to the wall and the 
actual device is mounted to this base. It is recommended to place the CO sensor on the sealing because 
CO is lighter than air and will always move upwards. The device is battery-operated and therefore in 
sleeping mode unless an action is detected. After a programmable sleeping time the device wakes up and 
sends a status information. After this the unit goes back to sleeping modus. Batteries can be changed 
without unscrewing the mounting base. The unit has tree colored LED to give visual warning when the 
battery is low or a CO alarm occurred.
</p>
</ProductDescription><h3 class="chapterTitle">Batteries</h3>
<content>
			<p>The unit is operated by batteries. Use only batteries of correct type. Never mix old and new batteries 
			in the same device. Used batteries contain hazardous substances and should not be disposed of 
			with household waste!</p>

				3  * CR123A</p>
<h3 class="chapterTitle">Installation Guidelines</h3>
<Installation>
<p>
<img src="img/VIS/ZS6301_1_en.png" width="500" align="middle">
<ol>
<li>Remove the bracket from the detector by rotating it counter-clockwise. </li>
<li> Place the bracket where you are going to install the detector. In each of keyhole slots, 
draw a mark to locate plastic anchor and screw. Using a 3/16-inch (5mm) drill bit, drills two 
holes at the marks and insert plastic anchor, and attached the bracket by using the screws.</li>
<li> Open the battery cover to insert the batteries, and then replace the cover. Fix the detector 
with bracket by rotating it clockwise.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<img src="img/VIS/ZS6301_2_en.png" width="500" align="middle">
<p>
Please follow the recommendations about amount and position of the sensor in your home as given above. Avoid
to place the sensor into the angle of walls, prefer positions in the middle of the room.
</p>
</Installation><h3 class="chapterTitle">Behavior within the Z-Wave network</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">I</span> On factory default the device does not belong to any Z-Wave network. The device needs to join an existing 
		wireless network to communicate with the devices of this network. This process is called <b>Inclusion</b>. 
		Devices can also leave a network. This process is called  <b>Exclusion</b>. Both processes are initiated by the 
		primary controller of the Z-Wave network. This controller will be turned into exclusion respective inclusion mode. 
		Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion or exclusion mode. 
		Only if the primary controller is in inclusion or exclusion mode, this device can join or leave the network. 
		Leaving the network - i.e. being excluded - sets the device back to factory default.</p>
		<p>If the device already belongs to a network, follow the exclusion process before including it in your network.
		Otherwise inclusion of this device will fail. If the controller being included was a primary controller, it has to be reset 
		first.  
		</p>
		
		</content><InclusionExclusion>
<p> Inclusion and Exclusion is confirmed by hitting the program button.</p>
</InclusionExclusion><h3 class="chapterTitle">Operating the device</h3>
<Usage>
<p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Power-on Mode</b>: 1) Install the battery into the module 2) The detector will emit a beep in 0.5 
seconds and the three LEDs will flash once quickly. 3) Close the bracket. The CO detector will alarm 
once remove the bracket.</li>
<li> <b>Stand-by Mode</b>: The Green LED flashes one time every 60 seconds. </li>
<li> <b>Alarm Mode</b> (It is the status when the alarm is triggered.): If a certain density of
CO is detected, an audible alarm with 4 beeps, pause 5 seconds and 4 beeps will occure. The red LED 
will flash continuously and rapidly. Meanwhile, the CO detector will send an alarm report (type: CO alarm, 
state: alarm) to the user’s controller and also the CO dectecor will send an alarm report (type: CO alarm, 
state: No alarm) while the alarm goes off.</li>
<li> <b>Error Mode</b>: If the CO detector beeps once and yellow LED flashes three times every minute, it indicates 
the CO detector is not working properly. Please require to repair or service. </li>
<li> <b>Low battery warning Mode</b>: The yellow LED will flash once every minute with a "beep" sound. </li>
<li> <b>Low sensitivity Mode</b>: The yellow LED will flash twice every minute with a "beep" sound. It indicates 
the CO detector has internal problem, please replace the unit. </li>
<li> <b>Tamper Mode</b>: The yellow LED will go solid and the detector will emit a short beep every minute until
the CO detector is mounted back to the bracket properly. </li>
<li> <b>End of life signal Mode</b>: The yellow LED will flash four times every minute with a short "beep" sound. 
It indicates the CO detector is reaching to the end of useful life, please replace with a new unit. </li>
<li> <b>Testing Mode</b>: Test the alarm by pushing test switch until the user hears 4 short beeps and three LEDs 
flash synchronously in five seconds. Then, the CO detector will send an alarm report (type: CO alarm, 
state: alarm) to the user’s controller and also the CO dectecor will send an alarm report (type: CO 
alarm, state: No alarm) while the alarm goes off. Please note if the CO detector only beeps once and yellow 
LED flashes three times every minute, it indicates the CO detector is not working properly. Please require 
to repair or service. </li>
<li> <b>Battery Power indicator</b>: The detector will report the current status of battery capacity to the user’s 
controller. </li>
<li> <b>Self-Protection Mode</b>: If the cover of detector removed from bracket, after 8 sec the detector will 
send an alarm report (type:0*02, level:0*FF) to the Z-Wave Interface Controller and the yellow LED will flash
continuously and the detector will sound. </li>
<li> <b>Silence Mode</b>: The user could press the test switch to get into silence mode to turn off the alarm 
temporarily when the CO detector alarms. Meanwhile, the red LED will flash continually. The silence function 
will automatically turn into normal operation if the CO concentration around the CO detector is still at 
alarming level after 4 minutes of silence mode. </li>
</ul></p>
<p>
WARNING: The carbon monoxide sensing unit has only 5-year limited life. For the security issue, 
we strongly recommend the user to change whole the CO detector after 4-year usage. </p>
</Usage><h3 class="chapterTitle">Wakeup Intervals - how to communicate with the device?</h3>
<content>
 		<p><span class="icon_white">W</span> This device is battery operated and turned into deep sleep state most of the time to save battery life time.  
 		Communication with the device is limited. In order to communicate with the device, a static controller <b>C</b>
 		is needed in the network. This controller will maintain a mailbox for the battery operated devices and store 
 		commands that can not be received during deep sleep state.
		Without such a controller, communication may become impossible and/or the battery life time is significantly decreased. </p>
		<p>This device will wakeup regularly and announce the wakeup state by sending out a so called Wakeup Notification.
		The controller can then empty the mailbox. Therefore, the device needs to be configured with the desired wakeup 
		interval and the node ID of the controller. If the device was included by a static controller this 
		controller will usually perform all necessary configurations. The wakeup interval is a tradeoff between maximal 
		battery life time and the desired responses of the device. </p>
		</content><Wakeup>
<p>Hitting the program button will wake up the device.</p>
</Wakeup><small><procontent>
		<p>It is possible to set the node ID to 255 to send wakeup notifications as broadcast. In this mode device takes more time to go 
		to sleep and drains battery faster, but can notify all it's direct neighbors about a wakeup. </p>
		</procontent></small><h3 class="chapterTitle">Node Information Frame</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">NI</span> The Node Information Frame is the business card of a Z-Wave device. It contains information about the device type and the technical
		capabilities. The inclusion and exclusion of the device is confirmed by sending out a Node Information Frame.  Beside this
		it may be needed for certain network operations to send out a Node Information Frame. </p>
		</content><NIF><p>Hitting the program button will send out an Node Information Frame </p>
</NIF><h3 class="chapterTitle">Associations</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">A</span> Z-Wave devices control other Z-Wave devices. The relationship between one device controlling another device is 
		called <i>association</i>. In order to control a different device, the controlling device needs to maintain a list of 
		devices that will receive controlling commands. These lists are called <b> association groups </b> and they are always 
		related to certain events (e.g. button pressed, sensor triggers, ...). In case the event happens all devices stored
		in the respective association group will receive a common wireless command. </p>
