<h3 class="chapterTitle">What is Z-Wave?</h3>
<content>
			<p>This device is equipped with wireless communication complying to the Z-Wave standard. 
			Z-Wave is the <b>international standard for wireless communication</b> in smart homes and buildings. 
			It is using the <b>frequency of 868.42 MHz</b> to realize a very stable and secure communication. 
			Each message is reconfirmed (<b>two-way communication</b>) and every mains powered node can act as a 
			repeater for other nodes (<b>meshed network</b>) in case the receiver is not in direct wireless 
			range of the transmitter.</p>
			
			<p>Z-Wave differentiates between Controllers and Slaves. Slaves are either sensors 
			<b>(S)</b> transmitting metered or measured data or actuators <b>(A)</b> capable to execute an action.
			Controllers are either static mains powered controllers <b>(C)</b> also referred to as gateways or mobile battery
			operated remote controls <b>(R)</b>.
			This results in a number of possible communication patterns within a Z-Wave network that are  partly 
			or completely supported by a specific device.</p>
			<img src="img/zoverview.png" width="250" align="right">
			<ol>
			<li> Controllers control actuators </li>
			<li> Actuators report change of status back to controller </li>
			<li> Sensors report change of status of measured values to controller </li>
			<li> Sensors directly control actuators </li>
			<li> Actuators control other actuators </li>
			<li> Remote controls send signals to static controllers to trigger scenes or other actions </li>	
			<li> Remote controls control other actuators. </li>			
			</ol>
 		</content><small><procontent>
		<p>There are two different role a controller can have. There is always one single primary controller that is managing
		the network and including/excluding devices. The controller may have other functions - like control buttons - as well.
		All other controllers don't manage the network itself but can control other devices. They are called secondary controllers.
		The image also shows that its not possible to operate a sensor just from a remote control. Sensors only communicate
		with static controllers.</p>
		</procontent></small><h3 class="chapterTitle">Product description</h3>
<ProductDescription>
<p>The Z-Wave 4 in 1 Sensor is designed with three detection sensors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Door-/Window</li>
<li>PIR/Motion</li>
<li>Temperature</li>
<li>Illumination</li>
</ul>
<p>The Philio Multi Sensor is a Z-Wave door/ window sensor, motion sensor, lighting sensor and temperature sensor in one package. Thanks to this the PSM02 can be uses as a security device or home automation device, e.g. to send an alarm when a motion is 
detected, turn the light on/ off automatically at night or to adjust the heater.</p>
<p>The product consists of two elements - the detector and the magnet. The magnet is mounted on the moving part of the window or of the door. The other part is placed on the frame.</p>
</ProductDescription><h3 class="chapterTitle">Batteries</h3>
<content>
			<p>The unit is operated by batteries. Use only batteries of correct type. Never mix old and new batteries 
			in the same device. Used batteries contain hazardous substances and should not be disposed of 
			with household waste!</p>
		</content><p>Battery Type: 
				1  * CR123A</p>
<h3 class="chapterTitle">Installation Guidelines</h3>
<Installation>
	<p align="center"> <img src="img/PHI/PHI_PSM02/PHI_PSM02_en.png" width="700" align="middle"></p>
	<ul>
	<li>Open the casing and dissemble the front part of the case.</li>
	<li>Put the included CR123A battery into the battery compartment and close the casing.</li>
	<li>The sensor consists of two parts; a Detector and a Magnet. They are designed to be fitted to doors or windows with the Magnet mounted on the opening part and the Detector mounted on the fixed frame. If used for motion detection mount the device at 
	a wall at about 2 m above surface. To enhance operation place the device on a position which can detect the room widely. Mount the device with the included screws or the adhesive tape on a plane surface.</li>
	</ul>
</Installation><h3 class="chapterTitle">Behavior within the Z-Wave network</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">I</span> On factory default the device does not belong to any Z-Wave network. The device needs to join an existing 
		wireless network to communicate with the devices of this network. This process is called <b>Inclusion</b>. 
		Devices can also leave a network. This process is called  <b>Exclusion</b>. Both processes are initiated by the 
		primary controller of the Z-Wave network. This controller will be turned into exclusion respective inclusion mode. 
		Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion or exclusion mode. 
		Only if the primary controller is in inclusion or exclusion mode, this device can join or leave the network. 
		Leaving the network - i.e. being excluded - sets the device back to factory default.</p>
		<p>If the device already belongs to a network, follow the exclusion process before including it in your network.
		Otherwise inclusion of this device will fail. If the controller being included was a primary controller, it has to be reset 
		first.  
		</p>
		
		</content><InclusionExclusion>
	<p>Tripple Click the Temper Switch on the backside confirms inclusion and exclusion.</p>
</InclusionExclusion><h3 class="chapterTitle">Operating the device</h3>
<Usage>
	<p>The detector can be used as a security device or home automation device. When the detector is cooperated with security appliances, the (1) Door/window or (2) PIR sensor act as an alarm detector. Alternatively, when the detector is worked with Z-Wave 
	controller, the detector can be set to perform the role of home automation device by detecting both changes in PIR motion detect or door/window open close signal with percentage of illumination lux levels.</p>
	<p>One home automation scenario is, once night falls, the percentage of ambient illumination is lower than preset value. If a person moves within or across the devices field of vision, a trigger radio signal will be transmitted so as to turn connected 
	lightings for better illumination.</p>
	<p>Another scenario is to combine (1) Door/window (2) PIR (3) illumination sensors to recognize people is coming in or going out and turn the light on/off automatically.</p>
	<p>The temperature sensor can detect the environment temperature so as to adjust heater or cooler to achieve preset temperature or detect the abnormal environment temperature (like freeze sensor or fire sensor) to send the warning message.</p>
	<p>After powering up the divice needs several minutes to setup and work properly.</p>
	<p>The device has a tamper switch, which starts alarm when the device is forcibly removed.</p>
</Usage><h3 class="chapterTitle">Node Information Frame</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">NI</span> The Node Information Frame is the business card of a Z-Wave device. It contains information about the device type and the technical
		capabilities. The inclusion and exclusion of the device is confirmed by sending out a Node Information Frame.  Beside this
		it may be needed for certain network operations to send out a Node Information Frame. </p>
		</content><NIF>
	<p>Tripple Click the Temper Switch on the backside sends out a Node Information Frame.</p>
</NIF><h3 class="chapterTitle">Associations</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">A</span> Z-Wave devices control other Z-Wave devices. The relationship between one device controlling another device is 
		called <i>association</i>. In order to control a different device, the controlling device needs to maintain a list of 
		devices that will receive controlling commands. These lists are called <b> association groups </b> and they are always 
		related to certain events (e.g. button pressed, sensor triggers, ...). In case the event happens all devices stored
		in the respective association group will receive a common wireless command. </p>			
		<p>Association Groups:</p>
		</content><p><table class="associations">
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>group 1 is for receiving the report message, like triggered event, temperature, illumination etc.
			(max. nodes in group: 7)
		</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>group 2 is for light control, the device will send the “Basic Set” command to this group.
			(max. nodes in group: 7)
		</td>
</tr>
</table></p>
<p></p>
<h3 class="chapterTitle">Configuration Parameters</h3>
<content>
		<p>Z-Wave products are supposed to work out of the box after inclusion, however certain configuration can adapt the 
		function better to user needs or unlock further enhanced features.</p>
		<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Controllers may only allow to configure signed values. In order to set values in the range 128 … 255 the value 
		sent in the application shall be the desired value minus 256. For example: to set a parameter to 200  it may be needed to set 
		a value of 200 minus 256 =  minus 56. In case of two byte value the same logic applies: Values greater than 32768 may 
		needed to be given as negative values too.</p>
