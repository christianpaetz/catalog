<ProductDescription>
<p>The Everspring Lamp holder allows controlling an electrical load both wirelessly 
via  Z-Wave and locally using the ON-/OFF button on the device. After the module is 
included into the controllers Z-Wave network, the lamp can be switched ON/ OFF by 
every associated device in the network. Pressing the On/Off button on the device 
will control directly the On/Off status of the connected incandescent lamp without 
using the wireless controller. This lamp holder is designed for 100W incandescent 
lamps and energy saving bulbs with a maximum load of 27W.</p>
</ProductDescription><h3 class="chapterTitle">Installation Guidelines</h3>
<Installation>
		<p> The device can be plugged into every E 27 Light bulb socket. Do not locate the Module facing direct sunlight, 
		humid or dusty place. The suitable ambient temperature for the module is 0°C ~ 40°C. </p> 
 	</Installation><h3 class="chapterTitle">Behavior within the Z-Wave network</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">I</span> On factory default the device does not belong to any Z-Wave network. The device needs to join an existing 
		wireless network to communicate with the devices of this network. This process is called <b>Inclusion</b>. 
		Devices can also leave a network. This process is called  <b>Exclusion</b>. Both processes are initiated by the 
		primary controller of the Z-Wave network. This controller will be turned into exclusion respective inclusion mode. 
		Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion or exclusion mode. 
		Only if the primary controller is in inclusion or exclusion mode, this device can join or leave the network. 
		Leaving the network - i.e. being excluded - sets the device back to factory default.</p>
		<p>If the device already belongs to a network, follow the exclusion process before including it in your network.
		Otherwise inclusion of this device will fail. If the controller being included was a primary controller, it has to be reset 
		first.  
		</p>
		
		</content><InclusionExclusion>
 		<p> <b>Inclusion and Exclusion are confirmed by a click of the button of the device.</b></p>
	</InclusionExclusion><h3 class="chapterTitle">Operating the device</h3>
<Usage>
 		<p> The device is able to switch a light bulb up to 100 W. The electrical load 
 		can be switching using wireless commands and operating the local button. The LED inside the local button
 		will indicate the switching status.</p>
 	</Usage><h3 class="chapterTitle">Associations</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">A</span> Z-Wave devices control other Z-Wave devices. The relationship between one device controlling another device is 
		called <i>association</i>. In order to control a different device, the controlling device needs to maintain a list of 
		devices that will receive controlling commands. These lists are called <b> association groups </b> and they are always 
		related to certain events (e.g. button pressed, sensor triggers, ...). In case the event happens all devices stored
		in the respective association group will receive a common wireless command. </p>
