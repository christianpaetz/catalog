<ProductDescription>
<p>This sensor offers information whether a door or window is open or closed. The product consists of a magnetic 
element and the main unit. 
One of the parts is mounted on the moving part of the window or of the door. The other part is placed on the 
frame. The installation can be done with 
screws or double-sided tape. The 2102 is a battery-powered device, which is in sleeping mode unless an action is 
detected. After a programmable sleeping 
time the device wakes up and sends a status information. After this the unit goes back to sleeping modus. 
Batteries can be changed without unscrewing the 
device from the door or frame. The units send information to a controller or any other associated Z-Wave device. </p>
</ProductDescription><h3 class="chapterTitle">Installation Guidelines</h3>
<Installation>
<p>1. Unscrew the screw fastening on the cover and slide the cover down.</p> 
<p> 2. Insert the CR123A battery into the batter compartment and the LED will start to flash slowly.
This means that the sensor is not yet included into a Z-Wave network.</p> 
	<p align="center"> <img src="img/VIS/VIS_ZD2102/VIS_ZD2102_en.png" width="500" align="middle"></p>	
	<p>3. Use the screws or adhesive tape to fix the cover on the frame along the opening edge of the door or window. See figure below.

	</p>
	</Installation><h3 class="chapterTitle">Behavior within the Z-Wave network</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">I</span> On factory default the device does not belong to any Z-Wave network. The device needs to join an existing 
		wireless network to communicate with the devices of this network. This process is called <b>Inclusion</b>. 
		Devices can also leave a network. This process is called  <b>Exclusion</b>. Both processes are initiated by the 
		primary controller of the Z-Wave network. This controller will be turned into exclusion respective inclusion mode. 
		Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion or exclusion mode. 
		Only if the primary controller is in inclusion or exclusion mode, this device can join or leave the network. 
		Leaving the network - i.e. being excluded - sets the device back to factory default.</p>
		<p>If the device already belongs to a network, follow the exclusion process before including it in your network.
		Otherwise inclusion of this device will fail. If the controller being included was a primary controller, it has to be reset 
		first.  
		</p>
		
		</content><InclusionExclusion>
 		<p><b>A single click for one second on the tampering switch inside the enclosure will confirm Inclusion and Exclusion.</b></p>
	</InclusionExclusion><h3 class="chapterTitle">Operating the device</h3>
<Usage>
<p>Whenever the door or the window where the sensor is mounted will open or close the device will 
send out a wireless signal.</p>
</Usage><h3 class="chapterTitle">Wakeup Intervals - how to communicate with the device?</h3>
<content>
 		<p><span class="icon_white">W</span> This device is battery operated and turned into deep sleep state most of the time to save battery life time.  
 		Communication with the device is limited. In order to communicate with the device, a static controller <b>C</b>
 		is needed in the network. This controller will maintain a mailbox for the battery operated devices and store 
 		commands that can not be received during deep sleep state.
		Without such a controller, communication may become impossible and/or the battery life time is significantly decreased. </p>
		<p>This device will wakeup regularly and announce the wakeup state by sending out a so called Wakeup Notification.
		The controller can then empty the mailbox. Therefore, the device needs to be configured with the desired wakeup 
		interval and the node ID of the controller. If the device was included by a static controller this 
		controller will usually perform all necessary configurations. The wakeup interval is a tradeoff between maximal 
		battery life time and the desired responses of the device. </p>
		</content><Wakeup>
<p><b> Releasing the tampering switch will wake up the device and keep it awake.</b></p>
</Wakeup><small><procontent>
		<p>It is possible to set the node ID to 255 to send wakeup notifications as broadcast. In this mode device takes more time to go 
		to sleep and drains battery faster, but can notify all it's direct neighbors about a wakeup. </p>
		</procontent></small><h3 class="chapterTitle">Node Information Frame</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">NI</span> The Node Information Frame is the business card of a Z-Wave device. It contains information about the device type and the technical
		capabilities. The inclusion and exclusion of the device is confirmed by sending out a Node Information Frame.  Beside this
		it may be needed for certain network operations to send out a Node Information Frame. </p>
		</content><NIF>
	<p>A single click on the tampering switch inside the enclosure will send out a Node Information Frame.</p>
	</NIF><h3 class="chapterTitle">Associations</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">A</span> Z-Wave devices control other Z-Wave devices. The relationship between one device controlling another device is 
		called <i>association</i>. In order to control a different device, the controlling device needs to maintain a list of 
		devices that will receive controlling commands. These lists are called <b> association groups </b> and they are always 
		related to certain events (e.g. button pressed, sensor triggers, ...). In case the event happens all devices stored
		in the respective association group will receive a common wireless command. </p>
