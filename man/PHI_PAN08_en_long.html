<h3 class="chapterTitle">What is Z-Wave?</h3>
<content>
			<p>This device is equipped with wireless communication complying to the Z-Wave standard. 
			Z-Wave is the <b>international standard for wireless communication</b> in smart homes and buildings. 
			It is using the <b>frequency of 868.42 MHz</b> to realize a very stable and secure communication. 
			Each message is reconfirmed (<b>two-way communication</b>) and every mains powered node can act as a 
			repeater for other nodes (<b>meshed network</b>) in case the receiver is not in direct wireless 
			range of the transmitter.</p>
			
			<p>Z-Wave differentiates between Controllers and Slaves. Slaves are either sensors 
			<b>(S)</b> transmitting metered or measured data or actuators <b>(A)</b> capable to execute an action.
			Controllers are either static mains powered controllers <b>(C)</b> also referred to as gateways or mobile battery
			operated remote controls <b>(R)</b>.
			This results in a number of possible communication patterns within a Z-Wave network that are  partly 
			or completely supported by a specific device.</p>

			<li> Controllers control actuators </li>
			<li> Actuators report change of status back to controller </li>
			<li> Sensors report change of status of measured values to controller </li>

		<p>There are two different role a controller can have. There is always one single primary controller that is managing
		the network and including/excluding devices. The controller may have other functions - like control buttons - as well.
		All other controllers don't manage the network itself but can control other devices. They are called secondary controllers.
		The image also shows that its not possible to operate a sensor just from a remote control. Sensors only communicate
		with static controllers.</p>

<ProductDescription>
<p>
The in-wall Roller Shutter Controller is designed to switch rise/lower roller shutter
connected to its terminals using Z-Wave or push buttons directly
connected to this Roller Controller. Additionally the device is measuring the power 
consumption and report it to a controller on request. The metering function is 
also used to protect the device from overload.</p>
<p>
The new smart relay calibration technology can reduce the inrush current caused by
the load and let the module work perfectly with many kind of roller shutter.
This in-wall Roller Shutter Controller is able to detect position of the Shutter by using
the patented power measuring method, so it can be remote controlled not only fully
up or down , but also can be adjusted to ex. 30% or 50%. And when manual
controlled by push button, the controller also can memorize the position and send the
new shutter position to its Z-Wave wireless controller (ex. IP-Gateway).
This device is designed for a 3 wire system and needs a neutral wire in the wall box.</p>
</ProductDescription><h3 class="chapterTitle">Before Device is installed</h3>
<content>
		<p>Please read carefully the enclosed user manual before installation of the radio-actuator, in 
		order to ensure an error-free functioning.</p>
		<p> ATTENTION: only authorized technicians under consideration of the country-specific installation 
		guidelines/norms may do works with 230 Volt mains power. Prior to the assembly of the product, the voltage 
		network has to be switched off and ensured against re-switching.</p>
		<p> The product is permitted only for proper use as specified in the user manual. Any kind of guarantee claim has 
		to be forfeited if changes, modifications or painting are undertaken. The product must be checked for damages 
		immediately after unpacking. In the case of damages, the product must not be operated in any case.
		If a danger-free operation of the equipment cannot be assured, the voltage supply has to be interrupted 
		 immediately and the equipment has to be protected from unintended operation.</p>	
		</content><h3 class="chapterTitle">Installation Guidelines</h3>
<Installation>
	<p align="center"> <img src="img/PHI/PHI_PAN08/PAN08_1.png" width="400" align="middle"></p>
	<p>Place the in-wall switch into a wall box and connect the pins as shown in the figure.</p>
	<p align="center"> <img src="img/PHI/PHI_PAN08/PAN08_2.png" width="200" align="middle"></p>

<p><b>Calibration</b></p>
<p>It is important to carry out a shutter calibration process before you control the
shutter to move. Press Z-Wave button over 3 seconds and release before the
6th second, the roller shutter controller will start the shutter calibration process.
The process is composed of three continue stages. The shutter move to the TOP
in first stage, and move to the BOTTOM in second stage, and move to the TOP
again in third stage. Then PAN08 will know the total range of UP and DOWN.
During the shutter calibration process, any emergencies happen you can press
and release the button to stop the process.
</p>
</Installation><h3 class="chapterTitle">Behavior within the Z-Wave network</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">I</span> On factory default the device does not belong to any Z-Wave network. The device needs to join an existing 
		wireless network to communicate with the devices of this network. This process is called <b>Inclusion</b>. 
		Devices can also leave a network. This process is called  <b>Exclusion</b>. Both processes are initiated by the 
		primary controller of the Z-Wave network. This controller will be turned into exclusion respective inclusion mode. 
		Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion or exclusion mode. 
		Only if the primary controller is in inclusion or exclusion mode, this device can join or leave the network. 
		Leaving the network - i.e. being excluded - sets the device back to factory default.</p>
		<p>If the device already belongs to a network, follow the exclusion process before including it in your network.
		Otherwise inclusion of this device will fail. If the controller being included was a primary controller, it has to be reset 
		first.  
		</p>
		
		</content><InclusionExclusion>
	<p>Tripple Click the button on the device confirms inclusion and exclusion. After power up it will stay in auto inclusion mode for 4 minutes. To support handling of the device when already installed the external switch can be used
for inclusion or exclusion for 3 minutes after power up.</p>
</InclusionExclusion><h3 class="chapterTitle">Operating the device</h3>
<Usage>
<p>
The manual operation of the blindcontrol is using traditional switches with two switched inside. 
One switch turns the blind in one direction, the other blind turns the blind into the opposite 
direction.
In case the motor is active due to the switching of the external switches all wireless commands 
are ignored. There is no start/stop function implemented with the external switches but direct 
control of the movement only.
</p>
</Usage><h3 class="chapterTitle">Node Information Frame</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">NI</span> The Node Information Frame is the business card of a Z-Wave device. It contains information about the device type and the technical
		capabilities. The inclusion and exclusion of the device is confirmed by sending out a Node Information Frame.  Beside this
		it may be needed for certain network operations to send out a Node Information Frame. </p>
		</content><NIF>
	<p>Tripple Click the button on the device sends out a Node Information Frame.</p>
</NIF><h3 class="chapterTitle">Associations</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">A</span> Z-Wave devices control other Z-Wave devices. The relationship between one device controlling another device is 
		called <i>association</i>. In order to control a different device, the controlling device needs to maintain a list of 
		devices that will receive controlling commands. These lists are called <b> association groups </b> and they are always 
		related to certain events (e.g. button pressed, sensor triggers, ...). In case the event happens all devices stored
		in the respective association group will receive a common wireless command. </p>			
		<p>Association Groups:</p>

<h3 class="chapterTitle">Configuration Parameters</h3>
<content>
		<p>Z-Wave products are supposed to work out of the box after inclusion, however certain configuration can adapt the 
		function better to user needs or unlock further enhanced features.</p>
		<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Controllers may only allow to configure signed values. In order to set values in the range 128 … 255 the value 
		sent in the application shall be the desired value minus 256. For example: to set a parameter to 200  it may be needed to set 
		a value of 200 minus 256 =  minus 56. In case of two byte value the same logic applies: Values greater than 32768 may 
		needed to be given as negative values too.</p>
