<h3 class="chapterTitle">What is Z-Wave?</h3>
<content>
			<p>This device is equipped with wireless communication complying to the Z-Wave standard. 
			Z-Wave is the <b>international standard for wireless communication</b> in smart homes and buildings. 
			It is using the <b>frequency of 868.42 MHz</b> to realize a very stable and secure communication. 
			Each message is reconfirmed (<b>two-way communication</b>) and every mains powered node can act as a 
			repeater for other nodes (<b>meshed network</b>) in case the receiver is not in direct wireless 
			range of the transmitter.</p>
			
			<p>Z-Wave differentiates between Controllers and Slaves. Slaves are either sensors 
			<b>(S)</b> transmitting metered or measured data or actuators <b>(A)</b> capable to execute an action.
			Controllers are either static mains powered controllers <b>(C)</b> also referred to as gateways or mobile battery
			operated remote controls <b>(R)</b>.
			This results in a number of possible communication patterns within a Z-Wave network that are  partly 
			or completely supported by a specific device.</p>
			<img src="img/zoverview.png" width="250" align="right">
			<ol>
			<li> Controllers control actuators </li>
			<li> Actuators report change of status back to controller </li>
			<li> Sensors report change of status of measured values to controller </li>
			<li> Sensors directly control actuators </li>
			<li> Actuators control other actuators </li>
			<li> Remote controls send signals to static controllers to trigger scenes or other actions </li>	
			<li> Remote controls control other actuators. </li>			
			</ol>
 		</content><small><procontent>
		<p>There are two different role a controller can have. There is always one single primary controller that is managing
		the network and including/excluding devices. The controller may have other functions - like control buttons - as well.
		All other controllers don't manage the network itself but can control other devices. They are called secondary controllers.
		The image also shows that its not possible to operate a sensor just from a remote control. Sensors only communicate
		with static controllers.</p>

<ProductDescription>
	<p>The Duwi Dimmer Flush Mountable is a wireless actuator able to dim lights up to 300 W. The device is delivered as a complete set with 
	flush mountable insert, paddle and mounting frame compatible to the design of the switching series DURO 2000 SI in color pearl white from 
	Busch-Jaeger. The paddle of the device is used to control the device. The status of the dimmer is indicated on a dual color LED for test 
	purposes. For dimming the devices apply leading edge phase cutting with a special alignment algorithm for inductive loads. It is therefore 
	possible to dim incandescent lamps, high voltage halogen lights and low voltage halogen lights with traditional transformer. Low voltage 
	halogen lights with switching power supply, LEDs and CFLs must not be attached. This device is designed for a 2 wire system. There is no 
	need for a neutral wire in the wall box.</p>
	</ProductDescription><h3 class="chapterTitle">Before Device is installed</h3>
<content>
		<p>Please read carefully the enclosed user manual before installation of the radio-actuator, in 
		order to ensure an error-free functioning.</p>
		<p> ATTENTION: only authorized technicians under consideration of the country-specific installation 
		guidelines/norms may do works with 230 Volt mains power. Prior to the assembly of the product, the voltage 
		network has to be switched off and ensured against re-switching.</p>
		<p> The product is permitted only for proper use as specified in the user manual. Any kind of guarantee claim has 
		to be forfeited if changes, modifications or painting are undertaken. The product must be checked for damages 
		immediately after unpacking. In the case of damages, the product must not be operated in any case.
		If a danger-free operation of the equipment cannot be assured, the voltage supply has to be interrupted 
		 immediately and the equipment has to be protected from unintended operation.</p>	
		</content><h3 class="chapterTitle">Installation Guidelines</h3>
<Installation>
		<p> The insert is designed to fit into standard circular European wall boxes with 60 mm diameter. The insert combined
		with the mounting plate can be screwed in top of the wall box using the two screws delivered with the device.
		The mounting frame is then attached to the mounting plate and the switch is completed by pushing the switching
		paddle into the mounting frame. Mind the arrow on the inserts top side showing the mounting direction of the insert.
		It is also possible to mount the insert without any local operation behind a cover or inside a lamp. The mounting plate, frame
		and the switching paddle become useless in such a scenario.</p>
		 <p align="center"> <img src="img/DUW/DUW_common/DUW_montage_common/DUW_montage_en.png" width="300" align="center"></p>
		 
		 <p> The schematics below shows how to wire the actuator. The hot wired from the mains distribution panel is connected to
		 the inserts contacts  <b>L</b>. The contact <b>S</b> is the switched contact and need to be connected to the cable to the load. 
		 The cable from the load is connected to neutral <b>N</b>. If there are both neutral and hot wire in the wall box the neutral 
		 from the mains panel and the neutral to the lamp need to be connected. It is not harmful if the two connections <b>L</b> and <b>S</b>
		 are mismatched on the actuator.</p>
		 <p> A fuse protects the electronics of the actuator. The fuse is accessible on the top side of the device.
		 Inside the plug there is the working fuse plus a spare fuse. </p>

 	</Installation><h3 class="chapterTitle">Behavior within the Z-Wave network</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">I</span> On factory default the device does not belong to any Z-Wave network. The device needs to join an existing 
		wireless network to communicate with the devices of this network. This process is called <b>Inclusion</b>. 
		Devices can also leave a network. This process is called  <b>Exclusion</b>. Both processes are initiated by the 
		primary controller of the Z-Wave network. This controller will be turned into exclusion respective inclusion mode. 
		Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion or exclusion mode. 
		Only if the primary controller is in inclusion or exclusion mode, this device can join or leave the network. 
		Leaving the network - i.e. being excluded - sets the device back to factory default.</p>
		<p>If the device already belongs to a network, follow the exclusion process before including it in your network.
		Otherwise inclusion of this device will fail. If the controller being included was a primary controller, it has to be reset 
		first.  
		</p>
		
		</content><InclusionExclusion>
 		<p> Blinking red/green LED indicates that the device is in factory reset state.
 		Once the controller is turned into inclusion mode <b> triple click one of the buttons on the device will
 		include the device</b>. A green blinking of LED will indicate successful inclusion that will be turned off shortly 
 		afterwards. The <b>device is excluded by triple click to one of the buttons</b> when the controller is in exclusion mode.</p>
	</InclusionExclusion><h3 class="chapterTitle">Operating the device</h3>
<Usage>
 		<p> The actuator is operated by the local switching paddles or wirelessly using Z-Wave commands (communication patterns 1, 4, 5 and 7). If the 
 		insert is mounted correctly pushing the upper part of the paddle will turn on the load; pushing the lower part of the paddle will turn 
 		off the electric load. Keeping the paddle pushed will dim up or dim down the load.</p>
		<p> The device is also able to remotely operate other devices 
		(communication pattern 5) by sending wireless Z-Wave commands. In case the remote device is a 
		switch as well the remote operation is similar to the local operation by pushing upper to lower part of the switching paddle.</p>
	</Usage><h3 class="chapterTitle">Child Protection</h3>
<content>
		<p> The device can be turn into a child protection mode. In this mode all local operation is disabled.</p> 
		</content><Protection>
	<p>The child protection mode MUST be turned on wirelessly. However in protected by sequence mode it is possible to unlock the device for local 
	operation with a triple click. The unlock state will last for 5 seconds.</p>
	</Protection><h3 class="chapterTitle">LED Control</h3>
<LEDControl>
	<ul>
	<li> Red and green blinking continuously: Device is not included in a Z-Wave network</li>
	<li> Red lights up for 3 seconds: Device was not included/excluded after being put into learn mode by triple 
	press of up/down button </li>
	<li> Green lights up for 3 seconds: The inclusion/exclusion was successful or new association was saved successfully </li>
	<li> Green or no light: depending on settings of configuration parameter for LED control </li>
	</ul>
	</LEDControl><h3 class="chapterTitle">Associations</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">A</span> Z-Wave devices control other Z-Wave devices. The relationship between one device controlling another device is 
		called <i>association</i>. In order to control a different device, the controlling device needs to maintain a list of 
		devices that will receive controlling commands. These lists are called <b> association groups </b> and they are always 
		related to certain events (e.g. button pressed, sensor triggers, ...). In case the event happens all devices stored
		in the respective association group will receive a common wireless command. </p>
