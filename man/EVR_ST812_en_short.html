<p><span class="icon_black">S</span> This device is a Z-Wave Sensor. Inclusion, Exclusion and wakeup are confirmed by three seconds clicking the tamper switch (Z-Wave Button) on the backside of the case.

<ProductDescription>
<p>This sensor monitors leakage and sends an alarm when flooding or leakage is detected. The sensing device can be away up to 3 m from the main device. The unit can be mounted on every flat surface. 
The installation can be done with screws or double-sided tape.</p>
<p>The ST812 is a battery-powered device, which is in non-operating state unless an action is detected. After a programmable sleeping time the device wakes up and sends status information. 
After this the unit goes back to non-operating state. Batteries can be changed without unscrewing the device from the door or frame. The unit will give a visual warning on the device and sends a warning to the 
Z-Wave controller, when batteries need to be replaced. The units send information to a controller or any other associated Z-Wave device. Up to 4 devices can be controlled from this device.</p>
<p>The device needs to be included into a Z-Wave network by a remote control or any other Z- Wave controller. For configuration of certain behavior a static controller such as a PC with home automation software 
or a gateway is recommended.</p>
</ProductDescription><h3 class="chapterTitle">Installation Guidelines</h3>
<Installation>
	<p align="center"> <img src="img/EVR/EVR_ST812/EVR_ST812_a.png" width="300" align="middle"></p>
	<p>1. Release the Sensor from the mounting plate and the battery cover by removing the fixing screws.</p>
	<p>2. Put the 3 * AA 1.5V batteries in the battery compartment.</p>
	<p>3. For mounting use mount plate and the screws.</p>
	<p>4. Refit the device to the back cover and secure with the fixing screw.</p>
	<p align="center"> <img src="img/EVR/EVR_ST812/EVR_ST812_b.png" width="500" align="middle"></p>
	<p>A clean smooth surface is required to mount the Flood Detector securely. The length of flood sensor cable is 3 meters. If a 3-meter cable is too long, roll up the cable and fasten it by twist ties. 
	The transceiver should be placed as high up as possible on the wall to improve communication and to prevent it from coming into contact with water in case of flooding.</p>
</Installation><h3 class="chapterTitle">Behavior within the Z-Wave network</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">I</span> On factory default the device does not belong to any Z-Wave network. The device needs to join an existing 
		wireless network to communicate with the devices of this network. This process is called <b>Inclusion</b>. 
		Devices can also leave a network. This process is called  <b>Exclusion</b>. Both processes are initiated by the 
		primary controller of the Z-Wave network. This controller will be turned into exclusion respective inclusion mode. 
		Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion or exclusion mode. 
		Only if the primary controller is in inclusion or exclusion mode, this device can join or leave the network. 
		Leaving the network - i.e. being excluded - sets the device back to factory default.</p>
		<p>If the device already belongs to a network, follow the exclusion process before including it in your network.
		Otherwise inclusion of this device will fail. If the controller being included was a primary controller, it has to be reset 
		first.  
		</p>
		
		</content><InclusionExclusion>
	<p>Make sure that your Z-Wave Controller is in the Inclusion-/Exclusion-Mode. Click three seconds on the tamper switch (Z-Wave Button) behind the mounting plate to confirm the process.</p>
</InclusionExclusion><h3 class="chapterTitle">Operating the device</h3>
<Usage>
<p align="center"> <img src="img/EVR/EVR_ST812/EVR_ST812_c_en.png" width="800" align="middle"></p>
<ol>
	<li>When water is detected, the orange LED of Detector will flash one second every one minute and beep 30 seconds and transmit radio signal to controller (option) simultaneously. In normal mode, 
	the Detector is allowed to be activated once in one minute, avoiding false trigger.</li>
	<li>When water is released, the green LED on the Detector will illuminate once and emit radio signal to controller (option).</li>
	<li>When the battery level on the Detector drops to a certain level, the red LED will flash once every 30 seconds and radio signal will be transmitted to controller (option). Please follow the 
	Battery Installation directions replacing the batteries as soon as red LED appears.</li>
</ol>
</Usage><h3 class="chapterTitle">Wakeup Intervals - how to communicate with the device?</h3>
<content>
 		<p><span class="icon_white">W</span> This device is battery operated and turned into deep sleep state most of the time to save battery life time.  
 		Communication with the device is limited. In order to communicate with the device, a static controller <b>C</b>
 		is needed in the network. This controller will maintain a mailbox for the battery operated devices and store 
 		commands that can not be received during deep sleep state.
		Without such a controller, communication may become impossible and/or the battery life time is significantly decreased. </p>
		<p>This device will wakeup regularly and announce the wakeup state by sending out a so called Wakeup Notification.
		The controller can then empty the mailbox. Therefore, the device needs to be configured with the desired wakeup 
		interval and the node ID of the controller. If the device was included by a static controller this 
		controller will usually perform all necessary configurations. The wakeup interval is a tradeoff between maximal 
		battery life time and the desired responses of the device. </p>
		</content><Wakeup>
	<p>Click three seconds on the tamper switch (Z-Wave Button) behind the mounting plate or a detected action by the sensor will wake up the device and keep it awake.</p>
</Wakeup><small><procontent>
		<p>It is possible to set the node ID to 255 to send wakeup notifications as broadcast. In this mode device takes more time to go 
		to sleep and drains battery faster, but can notify all it's direct neighbors about a wakeup. </p>
		</procontent></small><h3 class="chapterTitle">Node Information Frame</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">NI</span> The Node Information Frame is the business card of a Z-Wave device. It contains information about the device type and the technical
		capabilities. The inclusion and exclusion of the device is confirmed by sending out a Node Information Frame.  Beside this
		it may be needed for certain network operations to send out a Node Information Frame. </p>
		</content><NIF>
	<p>Click three seconds on the tamper switch (Z-Wave Button) behind the mounting plate or a detected action by the sensor sends a Node Information Frame.</p>
</NIF><h3 class="chapterTitle">Associations</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">A</span> Z-Wave devices control other Z-Wave devices. The relationship between one device controlling another device is 
		called <i>association</i>. In order to control a different device, the controlling device needs to maintain a list of 
		devices that will receive controlling commands. These lists are called <b> association groups </b> and they are always 
		related to certain events (e.g. button pressed, sensor triggers, ...). In case the event happens all devices stored
		in the respective association group will receive a common wireless command. </p>
