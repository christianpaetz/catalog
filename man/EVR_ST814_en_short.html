<h3 class="chapterTitle">Product description</h3>
<ProductDescription>The ST812 is a combined temperature/humidity sensor which is designed for both - desktop use or wall mountable. The device has a local LCD display which either shows the temperature or the humidity. 
Four buttons allow to switch between minimim, maximum or actual values, humidity versus temperature and Fahrenheit versus Celsius. The device can report its values via Z-Wave and allows to set trigger level for direct 
control of other Z-Wave devices, when the measured value hits the trigger point. This makes the ST814 a very powerful and flexible tool to measure environmental values and control device within a Z-Wave network.
</ProductDescription><h3 class="chapterTitle">Installation Guidelines</h3>
<Installation>
	<p align="center"> <img src="img/EVR/EVR_ST814/EVR_ST814_b_en.png" width="800" align="middle"></p>
	<p>The Temp./Humid. Detector can either be mounted on a wall or can be freestanding on a table. Please consider a most suitable way before mounting/ placing it.</p>
	<p>1. Release the Sensor from the mounting plate and the battery cover by removing the fixing screws.</p>
	<p>2. Put the 3 * AA 1.5V batteries in the battery compartment.</p>
	<p>3. For wall mounting use mount plate and the screws.</p>
	<p>4. Refit the device to the back cover and secure with the fixing screw.</p>
	<p>5. For table placing insert the stand into the hole on mounting bracket and turn 90 degrees lockwise.</p>
	<p>6. Once snapped in place, the detector can be placed on a shelf, table or other surface where the temperature and humidity measurements are desired.</p>
</Installation><h3 class="chapterTitle">Behavior within the Z-Wave network</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">I</span> On factory default the device does not belong to any Z-Wave network. The device needs to join an existing 
		wireless network to communicate with the devices of this network. This process is called <b>Inclusion</b>. 
		Devices can also leave a network. This process is called  <b>Exclusion</b>. Both processes are initiated by the 
		primary controller of the Z-Wave network. This controller will be turned into exclusion respective inclusion mode. 
		Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion or exclusion mode. 
		Only if the primary controller is in inclusion or exclusion mode, this device can join or leave the network. 
		Leaving the network - i.e. being excluded - sets the device back to factory default.</p>
		<p>If the device already belongs to a network, follow the exclusion process before including it in your network.
		Otherwise inclusion of this device will fail. If the controller being included was a primary controller, it has to be reset 
		first.  
		</p>
		
		</content><InclusionExclusion>
	<p>Make sure that your Z-Wave Controller is in the Inclusion-/Exclusion-Mode. Quickly click three times on the Linking button on the front of the device to confirm the process.</p>

<p><strong>3.1 Programming Z-Wave</strong></p>
<p><strong>Z-Wave's Groups (Association Command Class Version 2)</strong></p>
<p>The Temp./Humid. Detector can be set to send reports to or control associated Z-Wave devices. It supports two association groups with one node support for Grouping 1 and three nodes support for Grouping 2.</p>
<p>Grouping 1 includes POWER_APPLIED, SENSOR_MULTILEVEL _REPORT, ALARM_REPORT and BATTERY_REPORT_COMMAND. Grouping 2 includes BASIC_SET.</p>
<p><strong>Grouping 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>POWER_APPLIED command</strong></p>
<p>Whenever power is applied, it will send ALARM_REPORT command to the nodes of Grouping 1 to inform the devices that the detector is powered up.</p>
<p><strong>MULTILEVEL_SENSOR_REPORT</strong></p>
<p>The detector will emit SENSOR_MULTILEVEL_REPORT to inform the nodes of Grouping 1 automatically its current temperature and humidity. Refer to the section of Z-Wave's Configuration for settings of auto 
report configuration.</p>
<p><strong>Low Battery Report</strong></p>
<p>When the battery level of the detector drops to an unacceptable level, the Low Battery icon will appear on the LCD and the detector will emit ALARM_REPORT command to the nodes of Grouping 1.</p>
<p><strong>Grouping 2 (Max. Node = 3)</strong></p>
<p>When the detector is triggered, it will emit BASIC_SET_COMMAND to the nodes of Grouping 2.</p>
<p>Please refer to the table below for the setting of basic set command.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p>If the Z-Wave mode is OFF, no command will be sent even the Temp./Humid. Detector has been triggered. If Z-Wave mode is ON and the detector has been triggered, the device will send commands to nodes of Grouping 2.</p>
<p>If the Z-Wave mode reading is 00, it implies no node ID has been allocated by Z-Wave Controller. Please execute inclusion mode as described in the manual.</p>
<p><strong>4. Beep Tone</strong></p>
<p>To set the beep tone, press Select Mode button and select MODE 8. The Beep Tone icon flashes. Press Max. for ON and Min. for OFF. If it is ON, a beep tone will be sounded whenever a button is pressed; 4 continuous beep 
tones will be sounded for 1 second if the detector has been triggered.</p>
</Usage><h3 class="chapterTitle">Wakeup Intervals - how to communicate with the device?</h3>
<content>
 		<p><span class="icon_white">W</span> This device is battery operated and turned into deep sleep state most of the time to save battery life time.  
 		Communication with the device is limited. In order to communicate with the device, a static controller <b>C</b>
 		is needed in the network. This controller will maintain a mailbox for the battery operated devices and store 
 		commands that can not be received during deep sleep state.
		Without such a controller, communication may become impossible and/or the battery life time is significantly decreased. </p>
		<p>This device will wakeup regularly and announce the wakeup state by sending out a so called Wakeup Notification.
		The controller can then empty the mailbox. Therefore, the device needs to be configured with the desired wakeup 
		interval and the node ID of the controller. If the device was included by a static controller this 
		controller will usually perform all necessary configurations. The wakeup interval is a tradeoff between maximal 
		battery life time and the desired responses of the device. </p>
		</content><Wakeup>
	<p>Quickly clicking three times on the Linking button on the front of the device will issue a Node Information Frame and keep the device awake to receive configuration commands.</p>
</Wakeup><small><procontent>
		<p>It is possible to set the node ID to 255 to send wakeup notifications as broadcast. In this mode device takes more time to go 
		to sleep and drains battery faster, but can notify all it's direct neighbors about a wakeup. </p>
		</procontent></small><h3 class="chapterTitle">Node Information Frame</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">NI</span> The Node Information Frame is the business card of a Z-Wave device. It contains information about the device type and the technical
		capabilities. The inclusion and exclusion of the device is confirmed by sending out a Node Information Frame.  Beside this
		it may be needed for certain network operations to send out a Node Information Frame. </p>

<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">A</span> Z-Wave devices control other Z-Wave devices. The relationship between one device controlling another device is 
		called <i>association</i>. In order to control a different device, the controlling device needs to maintain a list of 
		devices that will receive controlling commands. These lists are called <b> association groups </b> and they are always 
		related to certain events (e.g. button pressed, sensor triggers, ...). In case the event happens all devices stored
		in the respective association group will receive a common wireless command. </p>
