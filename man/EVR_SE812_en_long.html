<h3 class="chapterTitle">What is Z-Wave?</h3>
<content>
			<p>This device is equipped with wireless communication complying to the Z-Wave standard. 
			Z-Wave is the <b>international standard for wireless communication</b> in smart homes and buildings. 
			It is using the <b>frequency of 868.42 MHz</b> to realize a very stable and secure communication. 
			Each message is reconfirmed (<b>two-way communication</b>) and every mains powered node can act as a 
			repeater for other nodes (<b>meshed network</b>) in case the receiver is not in direct wireless 
			range of the transmitter.</p>
			
			<p>Z-Wave differentiates between Controllers and Slaves. Slaves are either sensors 
			<b>(S)</b> transmitting metered or measured data or actuators <b>(A)</b> capable to execute an action.
			Controllers are either static mains powered controllers <b>(C)</b> also referred to as gateways or mobile battery
			operated remote controls <b>(R)</b>.
			This results in a number of possible communication patterns within a Z-Wave network that are  partly 
			or completely supported by a specific device.</p>

		<p>There are two different role a controller can have. There is always one single primary controller that is managing
		the network and including/excluding devices. The controller may have other functions - like control buttons - as well.
		All other controllers don't manage the network itself but can control other devices. They are called secondary controllers.
		The image also shows that its not possible to operate a sensor just from a remote control. Sensors only communicate
		with static controllers.</p>

<ProductDescription>
<p>The Siren SE812 Siren will warn everybody in the building by a loud sound and a flashing light about an alarm. This product is especially suited to use in combination with other Z-Wave devices such as sensors. 
The SE812 Siren gives a loud sound and a flashing warning light, so everybody in the building will know immediately that an alarm has occurred. You can choose to activate the siren either by burglary alarm or by a smoke 
alarm or activate the siren by both alarms. It is even possible to install multiple sirens, so the alarm can be heard loudly at multiple locations. The SE812 Siren has an adjustable jumper inside, so you can choose between 
either a 90dB or a 100 dB volume of the siren. Choose either the included batteries or a power supply to power your siren. When using batteries, the siren will give a warning when the batteries are almost empty.</p>

</Installation><h3 class="chapterTitle">Behavior within the Z-Wave network</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">I</span> On factory default the device does not belong to any Z-Wave network. The device needs to join an existing 
		wireless network to communicate with the devices of this network. This process is called <b>Inclusion</b>. 
		Devices can also leave a network. This process is called  <b>Exclusion</b>. Both processes are initiated by the 
		primary controller of the Z-Wave network. This controller will be turned into exclusion respective inclusion mode. 
		Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion or exclusion mode. 
		Only if the primary controller is in inclusion or exclusion mode, this device can join or leave the network. 
		Leaving the network - i.e. being excluded - sets the device back to factory default.</p>
		<p>If the device already belongs to a network, follow the exclusion process before including it in your network.
		Otherwise inclusion of this device will fail. If the controller being included was a primary controller, it has to be reset 
		first.  
		</p>
		
		</content><InclusionExclusion>
<p>When the device is first time powered up it is not included in a Z-Wave network and has no Associations. The Siren will stay "awake" for 10 minutes when power is first applied to allow the configuration.</p>
<p>1. Inclusion: For Inclusion bring your Z-Wave controller in the relevant mode and click the inclusion/exclusion switch quickly 3 times. The green LED is on and the siren beeps when the switch is pressed.</p>
<p>2. Exclusion: For Exclusion bring your Z-Wave controller in the relevant mode and click the inclusion/exclusion switch quickly 3 times. The green LED is on and the siren beeps when the switch is pressed.</p>
<p>3. Reset: For Resetting click the inclusion/exclusion switch quickly 3 times to bring the device in the reset mode. Within 1 second, press the switch again for 5 seconds until LED is off. 
The device now has factory settings. The orange LED is off and the siren beeps for 5 seconds.</p>
<p>4. Association: For Association bring your Z-Wave controller in the relevant mode and click the inclusion/exclusion switch quickly 3 times to bring it in the association mode. The device supports one association 
group with 5 nodes for Grouping 1.</p>
</InclusionExclusion><h3 class="chapterTitle">Operating the device</h3>
<Usage>
<p>Self-Protection Mode: Once the device is closed for three seconds and the tamper switch is activated it will give an alarm for 3 minutes, if it is violent opened or manipulated.
When the siren is in the normal mode and an associated device triggers an alarm the siren and the flash light will be activated.</p>
</Usage><h3 class="chapterTitle">Wakeup Intervals - how to communicate with the device?</h3>
<content>
 		<p><span class="icon_white">W</span> This device is battery operated and turned into deep sleep state most of the time to save battery life time.  
 		Communication with the device is limited. In order to communicate with the device, a static controller <b>C</b>
 		is needed in the network. This controller will maintain a mailbox for the battery operated devices and store 
 		commands that can not be received during deep sleep state.
		Without such a controller, communication may become impossible and/or the battery life time is significantly decreased. </p>
		<p>This device will wakeup regularly and announce the wakeup state by sending out a so called Wakeup Notification.
		The controller can then empty the mailbox. Therefore, the device needs to be configured with the desired wakeup 
		interval and the node ID of the controller. If the device was included by a static controller this 
		controller will usually perform all necessary configurations. The wakeup interval is a tradeoff between maximal 
		battery life time and the desired responses of the device. </p>
		</content><Wakeup>
	<p>Tripple click on the inclusion/exclusion switch or a detected action by the sensor will wake up the device and keep it awake.</p>
</Wakeup><small><procontent>
		<p>It is possible to set the node ID to 255 to send wakeup notifications as broadcast. In this mode device takes more time to go 
		to sleep and drains battery faster, but can notify all it's direct neighbors about a wakeup. </p>
