<h3 class="chapterTitle">What is Z-Wave?</h3>
<content>
			<p>This device is equipped with wireless communication complying to the Z-Wave standard. 
			Z-Wave is the <b>international standard for wireless communication</b> in smart homes and buildings. 
			It is using the <b>frequency of 868.42 MHz</b> to realize a very stable and secure communication. 
			Each message is reconfirmed (<b>two-way communication</b>) and every mains powered node can act as a 
			repeater for other nodes (<b>meshed network</b>) in case the receiver is not in direct wireless 
			range of the transmitter.</p>
			
			<p>Z-Wave differentiates between Controllers and Slaves. Slaves are either sensors 
			<b>(S)</b> transmitting metered or measured data or actuators <b>(A)</b> capable to execute an action.
			Controllers are either static mains powered controllers <b>(C)</b> also referred to as gateways or mobile battery
			operated remote controls <b>(R)</b>.
			This results in a number of possible communication patterns within a Z-Wave network that are  partly 
			or completely supported by a specific device.</p>
			<img src="img/zoverview.png" width="250" align="right">

			<li> Controllers control actuators </li>

 		</content><small><procontent>
		<p>There are two different role a controller can have. There is always one single primary controller that is managing
		the network and including/excluding devices. The controller may have other functions - like control buttons - as well.
		All other controllers don't manage the network itself but can control other devices. They are called secondary controllers.
		The image also shows that its not possible to operate a sensor just from a remote control. Sensors only communicate
		with static controllers.</p>
		</procontent></small><h3 class="chapterTitle">Product description</h3>
<ProductDescription>
<p>The Aeon Labs Multisensor is a USB or battery-powered Z-Wave motion sensor, temperature sensor, humidity sensor and lightness sensor in one package. 
The sensor will send radio signals up to 6 associated Z-Wave devices within its own Z-Wave network when the sensor detects IR changes in front of its viewing window. 
The Aeon Labs Multisensor complies with the IP43 standard so it can be used outdoors. By adjusting the sensitivity of the sensor you can avoid the triggering due 
to small animals like dogs or cats. The Aeon Labs Multi Sensor is delivered with a swivelling Back-Mount Arm for wall mount and a Back-Mount Plate for ceiling mount.
</p>
</ProductDescription><h3 class="chapterTitle">Batteries</h3>
<content>
			<p>The unit is operated by batteries. Use only batteries of correct type. Never mix old and new batteries 
			in the same device. Used batteries contain hazardous substances and should not be disposed of 
			with household waste!</p>
		</content><p>Battery Type: 
				4  * AAA</p>
<h3 class="chapterTitle">Installation Guidelines</h3>
<Installation>
	<p>1. Release the Multisensor from the mounting by rotating it counterclockwise (sign: "Lock"/ "Unlock")</p> 
	<p>2. Put the 4 AAA batteries in the battery compartment.</p>
	<p>3. The sensor can be mounted as follows:</p>
		<p> (a) For wall mount use the screws with the swivelling Back-Mount Arm. Further fix the sensor with Back-Mount Plate like shown in the picture. </p>
		<p align="center"> <img src="img/AEO/AEO_Multisens/wall_en.png" width="500" align="middle"></p>
		<p> Important: The Multisensor should be mounted with the Temperature/Humidity Sensor facing downwards and positioned on the bottom of the unit to protect it from snow and rain.</p>
		<p> (b) For ceiling mount use the screws with the Back-Mount Plate.</p>
		<p align="center"> <img src="img/AEO/AEO_Multisens/ceiling_en.png" width="500" align="middle"></p>
	<p>4. Mount the Multisensor on the Mount Plate by rotating it clockwise to the "Lock" sign.</p>
		<p>The next pictures are showing the effective motion sensor range for ceiling and wall mounting.

	</p>
</Installation><h3 class="chapterTitle">Behavior within the Z-Wave network</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">I</span> On factory default the device does not belong to any Z-Wave network. The device needs to join an existing 
		wireless network to communicate with the devices of this network. This process is called <b>Inclusion</b>. 
		Devices can also leave a network. This process is called  <b>Exclusion</b>. Both processes are initiated by the 
		primary controller of the Z-Wave network. This controller will be turned into exclusion respective inclusion mode. 
		Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion or exclusion mode. 
		Only if the primary controller is in inclusion or exclusion mode, this device can join or leave the network. 
		Leaving the network - i.e. being excluded - sets the device back to factory default.</p>
		<p>If the device already belongs to a network, follow the exclusion process before including it in your network.
		Otherwise inclusion of this device will fail. If the controller being included was a primary controller, it has to be reset 
		first.  
		</p>
		
		</content><InclusionExclusion>
	<p>Make sure that your Z-Wave Controller is in the Inclusion-/Exclusion-Mode. Click the little button behind the battery to confirm the process.</p>
	<p>A successful Inclusion/Exclusion lights up the sensor LED for a few seconds.</p>
	</InclusionExclusion><h3 class="chapterTitle">Operating the device</h3>
<Usage>
	<p> The Multisensor reports the temperature, humidity and lightness by request to a Z-Wave gateway or controller. 
		The sensor will send radio signals up to 6 associated Z-Wave devices within its own Z-Wave network.</p> 
	<p> The sensitivity of the motion detector can be manually adjusted via the Sensitivity Knob at the battery cover. 
	To increase the sensitivity rotate the Knob clockwise, to decrease it rotate it counterclockwise.</p>
 </Usage><h3 class="chapterTitle">Wakeup Intervals - how to communicate with the device?</h3>
<content>
 		<p><span class="icon_white">W</span> This device is battery operated and turned into deep sleep state most of the time to save battery life time.  
 		Communication with the device is limited. In order to communicate with the device, a static controller <b>C</b>
 		is needed in the network. This controller will maintain a mailbox for the battery operated devices and store 
 		commands that can not be received during deep sleep state.
		Without such a controller, communication may become impossible and/or the battery life time is significantly decreased. </p>
		<p>This device will wakeup regularly and announce the wakeup state by sending out a so called Wakeup Notification.
		The controller can then empty the mailbox. Therefore, the device needs to be configured with the desired wakeup 
		interval and the node ID of the controller. If the device was included by a static controller this 
		controller will usually perform all necessary configurations. The wakeup interval is a tradeoff between maximal 
		battery life time and the desired responses of the device. </p>
		</content><Wakeup>
	<p>A single click on the little button behind the battery will wake up the device and keep it awake.</p>
	</Wakeup><small><procontent>
		<p>It is possible to set the node ID to 255 to send wakeup notifications as broadcast. In this mode device takes more time to go 
		to sleep and drains battery faster, but can notify all it's direct neighbors about a wakeup. </p>
		</procontent></small><h3 class="chapterTitle">Node Information Frame</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">NI</span> The Node Information Frame is the business card of a Z-Wave device. It contains information about the device type and the technical
		capabilities. The inclusion and exclusion of the device is confirmed by sending out a Node Information Frame.  Beside this
		it may be needed for certain network operations to send out a Node Information Frame. </p>
		</content><NIF>
	<p>A single click on the little button behind the battery sends a Node Information Frame.</p>
	</NIF><h3 class="chapterTitle">Associations</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">A</span> Z-Wave devices control other Z-Wave devices. The relationship between one device controlling another device is 
		called <i>association</i>. In order to control a different device, the controlling device needs to maintain a list of 
		devices that will receive controlling commands. These lists are called <b> association groups </b> and they are always 
		related to certain events (e.g. button pressed, sensor triggers, ...). In case the event happens all devices stored
		in the respective association group will receive a common wireless command. </p>			
		<p>Association Groups:</p>
		</content><p><table class="associations"><tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Devices to be switched on upon motion deteced and off after a timeout (on time)
			(max. nodes in group: 5)
		</td>
</tr></table></p>
<p></p>
<h3 class="chapterTitle">Configuration Parameters</h3>
<content>
		<p>Z-Wave products are supposed to work out of the box after inclusion, however certain configuration can adapt the 
		function better to user needs or unlock further enhanced features.</p>
		<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Controllers may only allow to configure signed values. In order to set values in the range 128 … 255 the value 
		sent in the application shall be the desired value minus 256. For example: to set a parameter to 200  it may be needed to set 
		a value of 200 minus 256 =  minus 56. In case of two byte value the same logic applies: Values greater than 32768 may 
		needed to be given as negative values too.</p>
