<h3 class="chapterTitle">What is Z-Wave?</h3>
<content>
			<p>This device is equipped with wireless communication complying to the Z-Wave standard. 
			Z-Wave is the <b>international standard for wireless communication</b> in smart homes and buildings. 
			It is using the <b>frequency of 868.42 MHz</b> to realize a very stable and secure communication. 
			Each message is reconfirmed (<b>two-way communication</b>) and every mains powered node can act as a 
			repeater for other nodes (<b>meshed network</b>) in case the receiver is not in direct wireless 
			range of the transmitter.</p>
			
			<p>Z-Wave differentiates between Controllers and Slaves. Slaves are either sensors 
			<b>(S)</b> transmitting metered or measured data or actuators <b>(A)</b> capable to execute an action.
			Controllers are either static mains powered controllers <b>(C)</b> also referred to as gateways or mobile battery
			operated remote controls <b>(R)</b>.
			This results in a number of possible communication patterns within a Z-Wave network that are  partly 
			or completely supported by a specific device.</p>
			<img src="img/zoverview.png" width="250" align="right">
			<ol>
			<li> Controllers control actuators </li>
			<li> Actuators report change of status back to controller </li>
			<li> Sensors report change of status of measured values to controller </li>
			<li> Sensors directly control actuators </li>
			<li> Actuators control other actuators </li>
			<li> Remote controls send signals to static controllers to trigger scenes or other actions </li>	
			<li> Remote controls control other actuators. </li>			
			</ol>

		<p>There are two different role a controller can have. There is always one single primary controller that is managing
		the network and including/excluding devices. The controller may have other functions - like control buttons - as well.
		All other controllers don't manage the network itself but can control other devices. They are called secondary controllers.
		The image also shows that its not possible to operate a sensor just from a remote control. Sensors only communicate
		with static controllers.</p>

</Installation><h3 class="chapterTitle">Behavior within the Z-Wave network</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">I</span> On factory default the device does not belong to any Z-Wave network. The device needs to join an existing 
		wireless network to communicate with the devices of this network. This process is called <b>Inclusion</b>. 
		Devices can also leave a network. This process is called  <b>Exclusion</b>. Both processes are initiated by the 
		primary controller of the Z-Wave network. This controller will be turned into exclusion respective inclusion mode. 
		Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion or exclusion mode. 
		Only if the primary controller is in inclusion or exclusion mode, this device can join or leave the network. 
		Leaving the network - i.e. being excluded - sets the device back to factory default.</p>
		<p>If the device already belongs to a network, follow the exclusion process before including it in your network.
		Otherwise inclusion of this device will fail. If the controller being included was a primary controller, it has to be reset 
		first.  
		</p>
		
		</content><InclusionExclusion>
<p><b>Your Key Fob works perfectly as an additional remote control within an existing Z-Wave network. To include it into an existing Z-Wave network do the following steps:</b></p>

	</ol>
	<p>To exclude the Key Fob from the Z-Wave network repeat the steps above.</p>
</InclusionExclusion><h3 class="chapterTitle">Operating the device</h3>
<Usage>
<p align="center"> <img src="img/AEO/AEO_KFOB/AEO_KFOB_b_en.png" width="400" align="center"></p>
	<p>The Aeon Labs Key Fob can operate in three different modes: <strong>SETUP, GROUP</strong> and <strong>SCENE Mode</strong>.</p>
	<p>When the device is first time powered up it is in Setup Mode. This allows you to setup the Key Fob and do everything from creating a new Z-Wave network through to removing devices from one.
	In this mode the buttons operates as shown in the picture.</p>
	<p align="center"> <img src="img/AEO/AEO_KFOB/AEO_KFOB_c_en.png" width="400" align="center"></p>
	<p>To change your Key Fob to Group Mode open the main panel of the device so that you can see the internal light. Use the provided Button pin to press the Mode button. The LED will illuminate for a second 
	to confirm that the mode has been changed successfully to Group Mode.</p>
	<p>If you wish to change your Key Fob to Scene Mode, you'll need to configure it with your Z-Wave gateway. Please refer to the gateway's manual for this.</p>
	<p><strong>Setup Mode</strong></p>
	<p><strong>For an existing Z-Wave network</strong></p>
	<p>Your Key Fob works perfectly as an additional remote control within an existing Z-Wave network.</p>
	<p><strong>For a new Z-Wave network</strong></p>
	<p>Your Key Fob can be set as the primary controller of a Z-Wave network. This is recommended where you don't already have a Z-Wave network set up and you're either starting out or intending to set up 
	only a small system. As a primary controller of a new Z-Wave network, your Key Fob will be able to operate in Setup and Group Mode.</p>
	<p>In this case you need to associate your Z-Wave devices with the Key Fob. For details refer to the "Inclusion" part of this manual. Once this is done the Key Fob will work as the primary controller 
	and as a remote control within the Z-Wave network.</p>
	<p><strong>Group Mode</strong></p>
	<p>When using the Key Fob in Group Mode you are able to control different Z-Wave devices with each of your remote's 4 buttons. In Group Mode each button is capable of controlling up to 50 Z-Wave devices.</p>
	<p>For association do the steps as descriped in the chapter assiciotions.</p>
	<p>Now you can control the Z-Wave devices you have associated with the Key Fob. By pushing the particular button the device will not only switch on or off, but it is to the level you selected in the earlier steps. 
	With the Key Fob you have a further funcion to control multi-level devices. By holding a button for a particular device on the Key Fob the button will send up and down instructions to any compatible device. 
	Holding the button of a dimmable light will dim the brightness up or down.</p>
	<p>In order to disassociate devices with the Key Fob do the same steps like associating.</p>
	<p><strong>Scene Mode</strong></p>
	<p>When using your Key Fob in the Scene Mode you are able to control multiple Z-Wave devices with each of the 4 buttons of the remote. In Scene Mode each button is capable of controlling two scenes. 
	Each scene can contain 1 to 5 Z-Wave devices. Use your gateway to configure scenes in the Z-Wave network.</p>
	<p align="center"> <img src="img/AEO/AEO_KFOB/AEO_KFOB_d_en.png" width="300" align="center"></p>
	<p>Every of the 4 action buttons can control 2 scenes. To use the primary scene single click on the button. To use the secondary scene press and hold the button for 2 seconds and release it. 
	The numbering of the scenes (shown in the picture) is important to configure the scenes with your gateway.</p>
</Usage><h3 class="chapterTitle">Node Information Frame</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">NI</span> The Node Information Frame is the business card of a Z-Wave device. It contains information about the device type and the technical
		capabilities. The inclusion and exclusion of the device is confirmed by sending out a Node Information Frame.  Beside this
		it may be needed for certain network operations to send out a Node Information Frame. </p>
		</content><NIF>
	<p>A single click at the "Learn" button for 5 seconds sends a Node Information Frame.</p>
</NIF><h3 class="chapterTitle">Special Functions as Z-Wave Controller</h3>
<content>
		<p> As long as this device is not included into a Z-Wave network of a different controller it is able
		to manage its own Z-Wave network as primary controller. As a primary controller the device can include 
		and exclude other devices in its own network, manage associations, and reorganize the network in case of
		problems. The following controller functions are supported:</p>
		</content><h3 class="subchapterTitle">Include other device in own network</h3>
<content>
		<p> <span class="icon_white">CI</span> Communication between two Z-Wave devices only works if both belong to the same wireless network. Joining 
		a network is called inclusion and is initiated by a controller. The controller needs to be turned into the 
		inclusion mode. Once in this inclusion mode the other device needs to confirm the inclusion - typically by 
		pressing a button.</p>
		
		</content><ControllerInclusion>
	<p>When your Key Fob is setup as the primary controller in the Z-Wave network it's able to add and remove devices in the network.</p>
