<ProductDescription>
<p>The Z-Wave.Me Flush Mountable Motor Control is a wireless actuator able to control 230 V powered motors for blinds and jalousies. 
The device is delivered as a complete set with flush mountable insert, paddle and mounting frame compatible to the design of the switching 
series Everlux in color white from REV / Duewi. The paddle of the device is used to control the device itself but can also be 
configured to activate scenes in a central IP gateway or controller. The status of the motor control is indicated on a dual color LED for 
test purposes and every status change is - if configured - reported to a central IP gateway or controller. The function of the 
local paddle can be configured as detached from the local operation. In this local control different devices are controlled by 
Z-Wave while the local actuator is controlled by other devices using Z-Wave. This device is designed for a 3 wire system and needs a neutral 
wire in the wall box.</p>
</ProductDescription><h3 class="chapterTitle">Installation Guidelines</h3>
<Installation>
		<p> The insert is designed to fit into standard circular European wall boxes with 60 mm diameter. The insert combined
		with the mounting plate can be screwed in top of the wall box using the two screws delivered with the device.
		The mounting frame is then attached to the mounting plate and the switch is completed by pushing the switching
		paddle into the mounting frame. Mind the arrow on the inserts top side showing the mounting direction of the insert.
		It is also possible to mount the insert without any local operation behind a cover or inside a lamp. The mounting plate, frame
		and the switching paddle become useless in such a scenario.</p>
		 <p align="center"> <img src="img/ZME/ZME_common/ZME_montage/ZME_montage_en.png" width="300" align="center"></p>
		 
		 <p> The schematics below shows how to wire the actuator. The hot wired from the mains distribution panel is connected to
		 the inserts contacts  <b>L</b>. The contact <b>S</b> is the switched contact and need to be connected to the cable to the load. 
		 The cable from the load is connected to neutral <b>N</b>. If there are both neutral and hot wire in the wall box the neutral 
		 from the mains panel and the neutral to the lamp need to be connected. It is not harmful if the two connections <b>L</b> and <b>S</b>
		 are mismatched on the actuator.</p>
		 <p> A fuse protects the electronics of the actuator. The fuse is accessible on the top side of the device.
		 Inside the plug there is the working fuse plus a spare fuse. </p>
		 <p align="center"> <img src="img/ZME/ZME_05459/ZME_05459_en.png" align="middle"></p>
		<p> <b>CALIBRATION:</b></p>
		<p>The device is able to position a blind on a desired percentage position (50 percent open) when controlled wirelessly. To allow 
		this kind of positioning the total travel times of the motor in opening and closing direction must be determined using a simple clock.
		The two values need to be configured as configuration parameter <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>. Be aware that the percentage settings will 
		never be very accurate because the blind control actuator lacks a sensor to determine the correct position.</p>
 
 	</Installation><h3 class="chapterTitle">Behavior within the Z-Wave network</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">I</span> On factory default the device does not belong to any Z-Wave network. The device needs to join an existing 
		wireless network to communicate with the devices of this network. This process is called <b>Inclusion</b>. 
		Devices can also leave a network. This process is called  <b>Exclusion</b>. Both processes are initiated by the 
		primary controller of the Z-Wave network. This controller will be turned into exclusion respective inclusion mode. 
		Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion or exclusion mode. 
		Only if the primary controller is in inclusion or exclusion mode, this device can join or leave the network. 
		Leaving the network - i.e. being excluded - sets the device back to factory default.</p>
		<p>If the device already belongs to a network, follow the exclusion process before including it in your network.
		Otherwise inclusion of this device will fail. If the controller being included was a primary controller, it has to be reset 
		first.  
		</p>
		
		</content><InclusionExclusion>
 		<p> Blinking red/green LED indicates that the device is in factory reset state.
 		Once the controller is turned into inclusion mode <b> triple click one of the buttons on the device will
 		include the device</b>. A green blinking of LED will indicate successful inclusion that will be turned off shortly 
 		afterwards. The <b>device is excluded by triple click to one of the buttons</b> when the controller is in exclusion mode.</p>
	</InclusionExclusion><h3 class="chapterTitle">Operating the device</h3>
<Usage>
 		<p> The actuator is operated by the local switching paddles or wirelessly using Z-Wave commands (communication patterns 1, 4, 5 and 7). If the 
 		 insert is mounted correctly pushing the upper part of the paddle will turn the blind into the open position; pushing the lower part of the paddle will turn the blind into the close position. Hitting the paddle 
 		during operation (moving motor) will stop the operation for safety reasons. Keeping the paddle pushed moved the motor until the desired 
 		position is reached. Releasing the paddle will stop the motor. </p>
		<p> The device is also able to report status changes to a controller (communication pattern 2) and to remotely operate other devices 
		(communication pattern 5) by sending wireless Z-Wave commands. In case the remote device is a 
		switch as well the remote operation is similar to the local operation by pushing upper to lower part of the switching paddle. However
		the device can also be configured with configuration parameter <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> to operate remote dimmers. To dim a remote device
		the paddle needs to be pushed and hold (upper part to dim up, lower part to dim down). Its furthermore possible to assign remote operation 
		functions to the double click of the paddles.</p>
	</Usage><h3 class="chapterTitle">Child Protection</h3>
<content>
		<p> The device can be turn into a child protection mode. In this mode all local operation is disabled.</p> 
		</content><Protection>
	<p>The child protection mode MUST be turned on wirelessly. However in protected by sequence mode it is possible to unlock the device for local 
	operation with a triple click. The unlock state will last for 5 seconds.</p>
	</Protection><h3 class="chapterTitle">LED Control</h3>
<LEDControl>
	<ul>
	<li> Red and green blinking continuously: Device is not included in a Z-Wave network</li>
	<li> Red lights up for 3 seconds: Device was not included/excluded after being put into learn mode by triple 
	press of up/down button </li>
	<li> Green lights up for 3 seconds: The inclusion/exclusion was successful or new association was saved successfully </li>
	<li> Green or no light: depending on settings of configuration parameter for LED control </li>
	</ul>
	</LEDControl><h3 class="chapterTitle">Associations</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">A</span> Z-Wave devices control other Z-Wave devices. The relationship between one device controlling another device is 
		called <i>association</i>. In order to control a different device, the controlling device needs to maintain a list of 
		devices that will receive controlling commands. These lists are called <b> association groups </b> and they are always 
		related to certain events (e.g. button pressed, sensor triggers, ...). In case the event happens all devices stored
		in the respective association group will receive a common wireless command. </p>			
		<p>Association Groups:</p>
		</content><p><table class="associations">
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Single press and hold of up/down buttons
			(max. nodes in group: 14)
		</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Double press and press-hold of up/down buttons

</table></p>
<p></p>
<h3 class="chapterTitle">Configuration Parameters</h3>
<content>
		<p>Z-Wave products are supposed to work out of the box after inclusion, however certain configuration can adapt the 
		function better to user needs or unlock further enhanced features.</p>
		<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Controllers may only allow to configure signed values. In order to set values in the range 128 … 255 the value 
		sent in the application shall be the desired value minus 256. For example: to set a parameter to 200  it may be needed to set 
		a value of 200 minus 256 =  minus 56. In case of two byte value the same logic applies: Values greater than 32768 may 
		needed to be given as negative values too.</p>
