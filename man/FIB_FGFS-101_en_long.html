<h3 class="chapterTitle">What is Z-Wave?</h3>
<content>
			<p>This device is equipped with wireless communication complying to the Z-Wave standard. 
			Z-Wave is the <b>international standard for wireless communication</b> in smart homes and buildings. 
			It is using the <b>frequency of 868.42 MHz</b> to realize a very stable and secure communication. 
			Each message is reconfirmed (<b>two-way communication</b>) and every mains powered node can act as a 
			repeater for other nodes (<b>meshed network</b>) in case the receiver is not in direct wireless 
			range of the transmitter.</p>
			
			<p>Z-Wave differentiates between Controllers and Slaves. Slaves are either sensors 
			<b>(S)</b> transmitting metered or measured data or actuators <b>(A)</b> capable to execute an action.
			Controllers are either static mains powered controllers <b>(C)</b> also referred to as gateways or mobile battery
			operated remote controls <b>(R)</b>.
			This results in a number of possible communication patterns within a Z-Wave network that are  partly 
			or completely supported by a specific device.</p>
			<img src="img/zoverview.png" width="250" align="right">
			<ol>
			<li> Controllers control actuators </li>
			<li> Actuators report change of status back to controller </li>

		<p>There are two different role a controller can have. There is always one single primary controller that is managing
		the network and including/excluding devices. The controller may have other functions - like control buttons - as well.
		All other controllers don't manage the network itself but can control other devices. They are called secondary controllers.
		The image also shows that its not possible to operate a sensor just from a remote control. Sensors only communicate
		with static controllers.</p>

<ProductDescription>
<p>The Fibaro Flood Sensor will alert you of a threatening flood or a rapid temperature rise or drop and has a wide variety of additional functions. Thanks to its flexible gold telescopic probes the device can even work on uneven surfaces. 
The Flood Sensor has a built in alarm siren which will help you to react quickly in case of a flood, rapid temperature change or the attempt to tamper with it. Aside from the alarm siren, the device can alert you of a threat using colour displays 
from the built in RGB diode. In addition to this a tilt sensor will detect tilt and movement over 15 degrees and send out a report to the main controller. The built in temperature sensor can not only be used to serve as a fire alarm sensor, 
it may also be used to manage an in-floor heating system.</p>
<p>The Input terminal allows you to connect an external probe and install the sensor in any location. The Output terminal allows for a connection to an alarm system. The Sensor will work on 12 or 24V DC or battery.</p>
</ProductDescription><h3 class="chapterTitle">Batteries</h3>
<content>
			<p>The unit is operated by batteries. Use only batteries of correct type. Never mix old and new batteries 
			in the same device. Used batteries contain hazardous substances and should not be disposed of 
			with household waste!</p>

<h3 class="chapterTitle">Installation Guidelines</h3>
<Installation>
	<p align="center"> <img src="img/FIB/FIB_FGFS-101/FIB_FGFS-101_b.png" width="900" align="middle"></p>
	<p>There are two powering modes for the Fibaro Flood Sensor, <b>battery</b> or <b>mains current</b>. By default it's powered by a factory included battery. In addition it can work with a constant current, after connecting a 12 / 24V DC power supply to +12 
	and GND terminals. Powering mode configuration is carried out automatically, while a sensor is being included into the Z-Wave network. When battery powered, a Fibaro Flood Sensor communicates with a Z-Wave network main controller periodically. 
	Detected alarms are sent immediately, but configuration parameters and associations settings only at specified wake up intervals, or at a manual wake up (button triple click). In DC powering mode, configuration and associations parameters are sent 
	when necessary, and in addition a sensor serves as a Z-Wave signal repeater.</p>
	<p>Switching to a constant current powering mode:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Exclude a sensor from the Z-Wave network.</li>
	<li>Connect constant current power source (12 / 24 VDC) to +12 and GND terminals observing wiring (figure 1).</li>
	<li>Include the Fibaro Flood Sensor into the Z-Wave network.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In constant powering mode a sensor may operate without a battery. Installing a battery is recommended though, as it will serve as an emergency power source. When constant power fails, sensor will automatically shift to an emergency mode. 
	All reports, including flood and temperature, will be sent immediately, but it will not be possible to modify the configuration or association settings until constant power returns. If a sensor served as a signal repeater for other Z-Wave devices, 
	in emergency mode signal repeating function will be deactivated.</p>
	<p><b>Note:</b> Fibaro Flood Sensor will automatically exit emergency mode once 12/24 VDC at +12 and GND terminals is detected and the device wakes up after detecting an event, i.e. flood alarm, temperature report, tilt, or manual wake up using button.</p>
	<p align="center"> <img src="img/FIB/FIB_FGFS-101/FIB_FGFS-101_a.png" width="450" align="middle"></p>
	<p>The Flood Sensor can also be used with an additional extended wire for the water sensor. Drill a hole into the casing and connect the wire as shown in figure 2.</p>
</Installation><h3 class="chapterTitle">Behavior within the Z-Wave network</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">I</span> On factory default the device does not belong to any Z-Wave network. The device needs to join an existing 
		wireless network to communicate with the devices of this network. This process is called <b>Inclusion</b>. 
		Devices can also leave a network. This process is called  <b>Exclusion</b>. Both processes are initiated by the 
		primary controller of the Z-Wave network. This controller will be turned into exclusion respective inclusion mode. 
		Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion or exclusion mode. 
		Only if the primary controller is in inclusion or exclusion mode, this device can join or leave the network. 
		Leaving the network - i.e. being excluded - sets the device back to factory default.</p>
		<p>If the device already belongs to a network, follow the exclusion process before including it in your network.
		Otherwise inclusion of this device will fail. If the controller being included was a primary controller, it has to be reset 
		first.  
		</p>
		
		</content><InclusionExclusion>
	<p>Make sure that your Z-Wave Controller is in the Inclusion-/Exclusion-Mode. Tripple click the Z-Wave button inside the case to confirm the process.</p>
</InclusionExclusion><h3 class="chapterTitle">Operating the device</h3>
<Usage>
	<p>Fibaro Flood Sensor has two sensors built in - flood and temperature sensors, meaning it's a multichannel device. In the Z-Wave network's main controller the Sensor will be shown as two devices.</p>
	<p>Through an association Fibaro Flood Sensor may control another Z-Wave network device, e.g. a Dimmer, Relay Switch, Roller Shutter, RGBW Controller, Wall Plug, or a scene (scene only through the Home Center 2 main controller).</p>
	<p>Fibaro Flood Sensor allows for the associations of three groups.</p>
	<p><b>1-st Association Group is assigned to the device status</b> - sending the BASIC SET (default) or ALARM control frame to the associated devices.</p>
	<p><b>2-nd Association Group is assigned to a TMP button and tilt sensor</b> - ALARM GENERIC control frame will be sent to the associated devices in case a TMP button is released or a tilt sensor triggered (depending on parameter 74 settings).</p>
	<p><b>3-rd Association Group reports the device status and allows for assigning single device only</b> (the main controller by default - the device reports its status to the main controller).</p>
	<p>Fibaro Flood Sensor allows for controlling 5 regular and 5 multichannel devices per an association group, out of which 1 field is reserved for the Z-Wave network main controller.</p>
	<p><b>Z-Wave Range Test</b></p>
	<p>Fibaro Flood Sensor has a built in Z-Wave network range test for the main controller. Follow the instruction to test the main controller's range:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Press and hold a TMP button for 10 - 15 seconds, until a LED indicator colour changes to violet.</li>
	<li>Release the TMP button.</li>
	<li>Click the TMP button again.</li>
	<li>LED indicator will signal the Z-Wave network range (see description below).</li>
	<li>To exit the Range Tester click the TMP button.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Z-Wave Range Tester signaling modes:</p>
	<p><b>LED Indicator pulsing green</b> - Fibaro Flood Sensor attempts to directly communicate with the main controller. If the direct communication attempt fails, the sensor will try routed communication, through other devices, which will be signaled 
	with LED Indicator blinking yellow.</p>
	<p><b>LED Indicator glowing green</b> - Fibaro Flood Sensor directly communicating with the main controller.</p>
	<p><b>LED Indicator pulsing yellow</b> - Fibaro Flood Sensor tries to establish routed connection with the main controller, through intermediary devices.</p>
	<p><b>LED Indicator glowing yellow</b> - Fibaro Flood Sensor communicates with the main controller through other, intermediary devices. After two seconds the Sensor will retry to directly connect to the main controller, which will be signaled with the 
	Indicator pulsing green.</p>
	<p><b>LED Indicator pulsing violet</b> - Fibaro Flood Sensor communicates at the range limit. If connection proves successful it will be confirmed with a yellow glow. It's not recommended to use the sensor at the range limit.</p>
	<p><b>LED Indicator glowing red</b> - Fibaro Flood Sensor unable to connect to the main controller directly or through another Z-Wave network nodes.</p>
</Usage><h3 class="chapterTitle">Wakeup Intervals - how to communicate with the device?</h3>
<content>
 		<p><span class="icon_white">W</span> This device is battery operated and turned into deep sleep state most of the time to save battery life time.  
 		Communication with the device is limited. In order to communicate with the device, a static controller <b>C</b>
 		is needed in the network. This controller will maintain a mailbox for the battery operated devices and store 
 		commands that can not be received during deep sleep state.
		Without such a controller, communication may become impossible and/or the battery life time is significantly decreased. </p>
		<p>This device will wakeup regularly and announce the wakeup state by sending out a so called Wakeup Notification.
		The controller can then empty the mailbox. Therefore, the device needs to be configured with the desired wakeup 
		interval and the node ID of the controller. If the device was included by a static controller this 
		controller will usually perform all necessary configurations. The wakeup interval is a tradeoff between maximal 
		battery life time and the desired responses of the device. </p>
		</content><Wakeup>
	<p>Tripple click on the Z-Wave button inside the case will wake up the device.</p>
</Wakeup><small><procontent>
		<p>It is possible to set the node ID to 255 to send wakeup notifications as broadcast. In this mode device takes more time to go 
		to sleep and drains battery faster, but can notify all it's direct neighbors about a wakeup. </p>
		</procontent></small><h3 class="chapterTitle">Node Information Frame</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">NI</span> The Node Information Frame is the business card of a Z-Wave device. It contains information about the device type and the technical
		capabilities. The inclusion and exclusion of the device is confirmed by sending out a Node Information Frame.  Beside this
		it may be needed for certain network operations to send out a Node Information Frame. </p>
		</content><NIF>
	<p>Tripple click on the Z-Wave button inside the case or a detection by one of the sensors will send a Node Information Frame.</p>
</NIF><h3 class="chapterTitle">LED Control</h3>
<LEDControl>
	<p>Fibaro Flood Sensor is equipped with a LED diode, signaling sensor's operating modes and alarms. In addition the LED indicator may inform of the Z-Wave network range and the current temperature.</p>
	<p>LED indicator signaling modes:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Flood alarm is signaled with alternating white and blue light.</li>
	<li>In battery powering mode, with parameter no.63 set to 1, LED indicator will periodically show temperature readouts (depending on parameters 50, 51, 61 and 62 settings).</li>
	<li>In constant powering mode, the current temperature readouts will be continuously signaled with a colour depending on the parameters 50, 51, 61 and 62 settings.</li>
	<li>
<p>Currently chosen MENU position is signaled with an illumination colour. Press and hold the TMP button for at least 3 seconds to enter MENU. Inside MENU, each of the positions will be signaled by another LED colour:</p>
	<p>WHITE - entering MENU confirmation.</p>
	<p>GREEN - cancel alarm for associated devices.</p>
	<p>PINK - Z-Wave network's range test.</p>
	<p>YELLOW - sensor reset.</p>
</li>
	</ul>
</LEDControl><h3 class="chapterTitle">Associations</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">A</span> Z-Wave devices control other Z-Wave devices. The relationship between one device controlling another device is 
		called <i>association</i>. In order to control a different device, the controlling device needs to maintain a list of 
		devices that will receive controlling commands. These lists are called <b> association groups </b> and they are always 
		related to certain events (e.g. button pressed, sensor triggers, ...). In case the event happens all devices stored
		in the respective association group will receive a common wireless command. </p>			
		<p>Association Groups:</p>

<h3 class="chapterTitle">Configuration Parameters</h3>
<content>
		<p>Z-Wave products are supposed to work out of the box after inclusion, however certain configuration can adapt the 
		function better to user needs or unlock further enhanced features.</p>
		<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Controllers may only allow to configure signed values. In order to set values in the range 128 … 255 the value 
		sent in the application shall be the desired value minus 256. For example: to set a parameter to 200  it may be needed to set 
		a value of 200 minus 256 =  minus 56. In case of two byte value the same logic applies: Values greater than 32768 may 
		needed to be given as negative values too.</p>
