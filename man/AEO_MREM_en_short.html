<ProductDescription>
<p>The Aeon Labs mini remote control can control a variety of Z-Wave compatible devices such as switches, dimmers, 
window blinds and motion sensors. The device can include and exclude devices, group them and set and release associations. 
The mini remote only offers four control buttons for scene selection. Behind a slider there are four more buttons for Z-Wave network 
control. A non-replaceable but rechargeable battery powers the remote control. Recharging is done on a conventional USB 
bus using the charging cable provided. The product is in the color white.</p>
</ProductDescription><h3 class="chapterTitle">Installation Guidelines</h3>
<Installation>
		<p>The device is ready for use. In case there are no LED signals when hitting the buttons the device needs to be recharged
		using the USB cable provided.</p>
		<p align="center"> <img src="img/AEO/AEO_MREM_2.png" width="800" align="center"></p>
	</Installation><h3 class="chapterTitle">Behavior within the Z-Wave network</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">I</span> On factory default the device does not belong to any Z-Wave network. The device needs to join an existing 
		wireless network to communicate with the devices of this network. This process is called <b>Inclusion</b>. 
		Devices can also leave a network. This process is called  <b>Exclusion</b>. Both processes are initiated by the 
		primary controller of the Z-Wave network. This controller will be turned into exclusion respective inclusion mode. 
		Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion or exclusion mode. 
		Only if the primary controller is in inclusion or exclusion mode, this device can join or leave the network. 
		Leaving the network - i.e. being excluded - sets the device back to factory default.</p>
		<p>If the device already belongs to a network, follow the exclusion process before including it in your network.
		Otherwise inclusion of this device will fail. If the controller being included was a primary controller, it has to be reset 
		first.  
		</p>
		
		</content><InclusionExclusion>
 		<p> Once the primary controller is turned into inclusion mode <b> press the "Learn" button</b>.</p>
	</InclusionExclusion><h3 class="chapterTitle">Operating the device</h3>
<Usage>
		<p> The Minimote has 4 scene control buttons. A scene defines a certain switching state for a number of devices 
		connected to this scene. A single click on the scene button will then turn all these devices into the desired switching state.
		Below the cover there are 4 dedicated buttons for network management. The Minimote can manage a Z-Wave network as primary 
		controller. However it is also possible to reconfigure all 8 buttons for other functions e.g. activating a scene in a different 
		controller.</p>
	</Usage><h3 class="chapterTitle">Wakeup Intervals - how to communicate with the device?</h3>
<content>
 		<p><span class="icon_white">W</span> This device is battery operated and turned into deep sleep state most of the time to save battery life time.  
 		Communication with the device is limited. In order to communicate with the device, a static controller <b>C</b>
 		is needed in the network. This controller will maintain a mailbox for the battery operated devices and store 
 		commands that can not be received during deep sleep state.
		Without such a controller, communication may become impossible and/or the battery life time is significantly decreased. </p>
		<p>This device will wakeup regularly and announce the wakeup state by sending out a so called Wakeup Notification.
		The controller can then empty the mailbox. Therefore, the device needs to be configured with the desired wakeup 
		interval and the node ID of the controller. If the device was included by a static controller this 
		controller will usually perform all necessary configurations. The wakeup interval is a tradeoff between maximal 
		battery life time and the desired responses of the device. </p>
		</content><Wakeup>
		<p>The device can be woken up manually by pressing the "Learn" button for 5 seconds.</p>
	</Wakeup><small><procontent>
		<p>It is possible to set the node ID to 255 to send wakeup notifications as broadcast. In this mode device takes more time to go 
		to sleep and drains battery faster, but can notify all it's direct neighbors about a wakeup. </p>
		</procontent></small><h3 class="chapterTitle">Node Information Frame</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">NI</span> The Node Information Frame is the business card of a Z-Wave device. It contains information about the device type and the technical
		capabilities. The inclusion and exclusion of the device is confirmed by sending out a Node Information Frame.  Beside this
		it may be needed for certain network operations to send out a Node Information Frame. </p>
		</content><NIF>
	<p>A single click at the "Learn" button for 5 seconds sends a Node Information Frame.</p>
	</NIF><h3 class="chapterTitle">Associations</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">A</span> Z-Wave devices control other Z-Wave devices. The relationship between one device controlling another device is 
		called <i>association</i>. In order to control a different device, the controlling device needs to maintain a list of 
		devices that will receive controlling commands. These lists are called <b> association groups </b> and they are always 
		related to certain events (e.g. button pressed, sensor triggers, ...). In case the event happens all devices stored
		in the respective association group will receive a common wireless command. </p>			
		<p>Association Groups:</p>

		a button. Please refer to the manual of this device how to issue a NIF.</li>
		<li> Before releasing the scene button turn the device into the desired state. After the button is released the minimote
		will detect the status of the device and store it in the scene.</li>

<content>
		<p> As long as this device is not included into a Z-Wave network of a different controller it is able
		to manage its own Z-Wave network as primary controller. As a primary controller the device can include 
		and exclude other devices in its own network, manage associations, and reorganize the network in case of
		problems. The following controller functions are supported:</p>
		</content><h3 class="subchapterTitle">Include other device in own network</h3>
<content>
		<p> <span class="icon_white">CI</span> Communication between two Z-Wave devices only works if both belong to the same wireless network. Joining 
		a network is called inclusion and is initiated by a controller. The controller needs to be turned into the 
		inclusion mode. Once in this inclusion mode the other device needs to confirm the inclusion - typically by 
		pressing a button.</p>
		
		</content><ControllerInclusion>	
		<p>Click the "Inclusion" button to start the inclusion mode.</p>
		<p>If inclusion of a new device fails, first exclude it from its previous network or reset it.</p>
	</ControllerInclusion><small><procontent>
		<p>If current primary controller in your network is in special SIS mode this and any other secondary controller 
		can also include and exclude devices.</p>
		<p> To become primary a contoller have to be resetted  and then include a device.</p>
		</procontent></small><h3 class="subchapterTitle">Exclude device from network</h3>
<content>
		<p>The primary controller can exclude devices from the Z-Wave network. During exclusion the relationship between the device and the network
		of this controller is terminated. No communication between the device and other devices still in the network can happen after a successful
		exclusion. The controller needs to be turned into the exclusion mode. Once in this exclusion mode the other device needs to confirm the exclusion - typically by pressing a button.</p>
		<p><b>Attention:</b> Removing a device from the network means that it is turned back into factory default status.
		This process can also exclude devices from it's previous network.</p>

		<p> The primary shift is initiated on the device by pressing the "Learn" button. </p>
	</PrimaryShift><h3 class="subchapterTitle">Set association between two device in Z-Wave network</h3>
<content>
			<p><span class="icon_white">CA</span> The controller is able to set association between two other devices in the network. The controller is turned
			into an association mode both devices are announced by pressing a button. After both association partners are known
			the controller will perform all necessary steps to set the association.</p>

		<li> Issue a Node Information Frame from the device where the association will be set. This is usually done 
		by single or triple click a button. Please refer to the manual of this device how to issue a NIF.</li>
		</ol>
	</SetAssignedAssociation><h3 class="subchapterTitle">Update Network Information</h3>
<content>
		<p>As a battery operated controller the device will not automatically received updates about the network structure. 
		This process should be initiated when the primary controller has included/excluded devices and it will result in
		an update of the network information in the battery operated controller. This prevents wrong communication that
		may cost battery life and delay other communication.</p>
		</content><NetworkUpdate>
		<p> Press the button "Association" for 10 seconds to update the network.</p>
	</NetworkUpdate><small><procontent>
		<p> it is possible that a network update fails if the network was changed too much after the last update. In this case 
		the the device need to be reincluded. Re-Inclusion is similar to a normal inclusion. Its just not needed to exclude 
		the device before. Re-Inclusion makes sure that the node ID of the device remails unchanged.</p>
		</procontent></small><h3 class="subchapterTitle">Reset the Controller</h3>
<content>
		</content><Reset>
	<p>Press the buttons "Association" and "Learn" together for 10 seconds to reset the device.</p>
	</Reset><h3 class="chapterTitle">Configuration Parameters</h3>
<content>
		<p>Z-Wave products are supposed to work out of the box after inclusion, however certain configuration can adapt the 
		function better to user needs or unlock further enhanced features.</p>
		<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Controllers may only allow to configure signed values. In order to set values in the range 128 … 255 the value 
		sent in the application shall be the desired value minus 256. For example: to set a parameter to 200  it may be needed to set 
		a value of 200 minus 256 =  minus 56. In case of two byte value the same logic applies: Values greater than 32768 may 
		needed to be given as negative values too.</p>
