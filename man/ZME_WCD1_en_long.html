<h3 class="chapterTitle">What is Z-Wave?</h3>
<content>
			<p>This device is equipped with wireless communication complying to the Z-Wave standard. 
			Z-Wave is the <b>international standard for wireless communication</b> in smart homes and buildings. 
			It is using the <b>frequency of 868.42 MHz</b> to realize a very stable and secure communication. 
			Each message is reconfirmed (<b>two-way communication</b>) and every mains powered node can act as a 
			repeater for other nodes (<b>meshed network</b>) in case the receiver is not in direct wireless 
			range of the transmitter.</p>
			
			<p>Z-Wave differentiates between Controllers and Slaves. Slaves are either sensors 
			<b>(S)</b> transmitting metered or measured data or actuators <b>(A)</b> capable to execute an action.
			Controllers are either static mains powered controllers <b>(C)</b> also referred to as gateways or mobile battery
			operated remote controls <b>(R)</b>.
			This results in a number of possible communication patterns within a Z-Wave network that are  partly 
			or completely supported by a specific device.</p>

		<p>There are two different role a controller can have. There is always one single primary controller that is managing
		the network and including/excluding devices. The controller may have other functions - like control buttons - as well.
		All other controllers don't manage the network itself but can control other devices. They are called secondary controllers.
		The image also shows that its not possible to operate a sensor just from a remote control. Sensors only communicate
		with static controllers.</p>

<ProductDescription> 
	<p>The Z-Wave.Me Wall Controller is a Z-Wave device that can both control other Z-Wave devices and activate predefined scenes in an IP gateway. Although it is controlling other devices, the Wall Controller cannot act as Z-Wave network controller 
	(primary or secondary) and will always need a Z-Wave network controller to be included into a Z-Wave network. The device can be used in different modes that are selected by configuration parameters: </p>
	<ol> 
	<li>Control of groups of other Z-Wave devices using 'ON', 'OFF' and Dim commands.</li> 
	<li>Control of devices in proximity of the Wall Controller using 'ALL ON' or 'ALL OFF' commands.</li>
	<li>Activation of predefined scenes in Gateways or other Z-Wave devices.</li>
	</ol>
	</ProductDescription><h3 class="chapterTitle">Batteries</h3>
<content>
			<p>The unit is operated by batteries. Use only batteries of correct type. Never mix old and new batteries 
			in the same device. Used batteries contain hazardous substances and should not be disposed of 
			with household waste!</p>
		</content><p>Battery Type: 
				1  * CR2032</p>
<h3 class="chapterTitle">Installation Guidelines</h3>
<Installation>
	<p>The device comes ready to use with a battery already installed. On factory default the device is not included in any network and any button push will result in a long red blink of the LED, indicating an error. This behavior can be used to test the factory 
	default or exclusion state.</p>
	<p align="center"> <img src="img/ZME/ZME_WALLC/ZME_WALLC_a.png" width="300" align="middle"></p>
	<p>The device can be mounted on every dry and flat surface using either screws or double side adhesive. First the mounting base is fixed on the wall. Next step the switch frame is placed on the 2 frame and the electronic insert is used to fix the 
	frame to the mounting base as shown on the image. Finally the switching paddle(s) are mounted on the electronic base.</p>
	<p>For battery change, the switching paddle(s) need to be removed. The CR battery can be replaced by pushing the little nipple above the battery. The old battery will slide out and the new battery is inserted until the nipple will hold it again.</p>
	<p>The device can be operated in two different modes:
	<ul>
	<li>
<strong>Operation Mode:</strong> This is the mode where the device is controlling other Z-Wave devices or is activating scenes.</li>
	<li>
<strong>Management Mode:</strong> The device is turned into the management mode by pushing all four buttons for 5 sec. A blinking green LED indicates the management mode. In the management mode the buttons of the device have different functions. 
	If no further action is performed, the device will turn back to the normal mode after 10 sec. Any management action terminates the management mode as well.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>In management mode the following actions can be performed:</p>
	<p align="center"> <img src="img/ZME/ZME_WALLC/ZME_WALLC_b_en.png" width="500" align="middle"></p>
	<ul>
	<li>Button 1 - Network Wide Inclusion: The device can be included into a Z-Wave network from any physical location in the network. This requires a primary controller supporting Explorer Frames. This mode lasts for 20 seconds and stops automatically. 
	Any button press stops the mode as well.</li>
	<li>Button 2 - Send Node Information Frame and Wake up Notification. (See explanation in the respective chapters below)</li>
	<li>Button 3 – Standard Inclusion/Exclusion Mode: The device is included or excluded from a controller in direct wireless range. Any button press stops the mode. Performing an exclusion of the device from a network resets the device into its factory default.</li>
	<li>Button 4 - Association Set: To assign target devices to one of the four association groups. Refer to the manuals section about association for more information how to set and unset association groups.</li>
	</ul>
	</Installation><h3 class="chapterTitle">Behavior within the Z-Wave network</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">I</span> On factory default the device does not belong to any Z-Wave network. The device needs to join an existing 
		wireless network to communicate with the devices of this network. This process is called <b>Inclusion</b>. 
		Devices can also leave a network. This process is called  <b>Exclusion</b>. Both processes are initiated by the 
		primary controller of the Z-Wave network. This controller will be turned into exclusion respective inclusion mode. 
		Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion or exclusion mode. 
		Only if the primary controller is in inclusion or exclusion mode, this device can join or leave the network. 
		Leaving the network - i.e. being excluded - sets the device back to factory default.</p>
		<p>If the device already belongs to a network, follow the exclusion process before including it in your network.
		Otherwise inclusion of this device will fail. If the controller being included was a primary controller, it has to be reset 
		first.  
		</p>
		
		</content><InclusionExclusion>
 	<p> Once the controller is turned into inclusion mode <b> turn the Wall Controller into management mode and hit button 3.</b>
	The <b>device is excluded by entering management mode and hitting button 3 </b> when the controller is in exclusion mode. 
	To include/exclude the device in the NWI mode <b>turn the Wall Controller into management mode and hit button 1.</b></p>
	</InclusionExclusion><h3 class="chapterTitle">Operating the device</h3>
<Usage>	
 	<p>Depending on the button mode and command set configured the device can be used in different ways.</p>
 	<p class="subchapterTitle"><strong>Button modes:</strong></p>
 	<p><b>Control with two groups of two buttons</b> (This is the default mode) One group (No. 1) of devices is controlled by button 1 and 3, the other group (No. 2) is controlled by button 2 and 4. Clicking the larger button turns the loads 'ON', 
	clicking the smaller button turns the loads 'OFF'. If double clicks are enabled in configuration parameters #1 or #2, groups No. 3 and No. 4 are controlled by short double click of the buttons.</p>
	<p>Dimming commands are sent by holding down the buttons (Dim UP using Buttons 1 and 2, Dim Down using Buttons 3 and 4) respective Click + Hold in case the double click option is enabled.</p>
	<p align="center"> <img src="img/ZME/ZME_WALLC/ZME_WALLC_d_en.png" width="300" align="middle"></p>
 	<p><b>Control with single buttons</b> In this mode a group of devices is controlled by a single button: single click turns 'ON'; double click turns 'OFF' devices in the group. In case dimmers are controlled, holding down the button will dim up, 
	click and hold down will dim down the load. The group number corresponds to the button label.</p>
	<p align="center"> <img src="img/ZME/ZME_WALLC/ZME_WALLC_c_en.png" width="300" align="middle"></p>
	<p class="subchapterTitle"><strong>Control Commands:</strong></p>
	<p>The configuration parameter #11…#14 specifies what commands are sent when the buttons are operated.</p>
 	<p><b>Direct Control of associated devices using 'ON', 'OFF', 'DIM UP' and 'DIM DOWN'</b> The special commands 'ALL ON' resp. 'ALL OFF' are sent as broadcast to all devices in direct wireless range. The devices act according to their individual 
	settings for 'Switch ALL' commands. This mode implements the communication pattern 7.</p>
 	<p><b>Simple Scene Activation using configurable scene control commands.</b>.
 	Associated devices in an association group are controlled by individual commands defined by Z-Wave command class 'Scene Controller Configuration'. One scene number can be configured per association group. On default, the scene number equals 
	the association group number as shown in the figure below. This mode implements communication patterns 6 and 7. This mode is typically used to activate scenes in IP gateways but can also be used to activate predefined scenes in other scene-capable devices.</p>
	<p align="center"> <img src="img/ZME/ZME_WALLC/ZME_WALLC_e_en.png" width="300" align="middle"></p>
	<p class="subchapterTitle"><strong>Enhanced Scene Activation:</strong></p>
	<p>In this mode every button action can issue a scene activation command with a dedicated number. The scene number is a combination of the group number and the action performed on the button and has always two digits. The group number defines the 
	upper digit of the scene number, the action the lower digit. The following actions are possible:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>1 = On</li>
	<li>2 = Off</li>
	<li>3 = Dim Up Start</li>
	<li>4 = Dim Down Start</li>
	<li>5 = Dim Up Stop</li>
	<li>6 = Dim Down Stop</li>
	</ul>
 	<p>Example: Clicking/double clicking the button 1 will issue a scene activation command for scene 11 (button 1 click, event on) and scene 12 (button double click 1, event off, single button control is used in this example). This mode implements the 
	communication pattern <b>6</b>.</p>	
	</Usage><h3 class="chapterTitle">Child Protection</h3>
<content>
		<p> The device can be turn into a child protection mode. In this mode all local operation is disabled.</p> 
		</content><Protection>
	<p>The device can be turned into a child protection mode. In this mode all local operation is disabled. The child protection mode MUST be turned on wirelessly. However, in protected by sequence mode it is possible to unlock the device for local 
	operation by pressing any button for 5 seconds. The unlock state will last for 5 seconds.</p>
	</Protection><h3 class="chapterTitle">Wakeup Intervals - how to communicate with the device?</h3>
<content>
 		<p><span class="icon_white">W</span> This device is battery operated and turned into deep sleep state most of the time to save battery life time.  
 		Communication with the device is limited. In order to communicate with the device, a static controller <b>C</b>
 		is needed in the network. This controller will maintain a mailbox for the battery operated devices and store 
 		commands that can not be received during deep sleep state.
		Without such a controller, communication may become impossible and/or the battery life time is significantly decreased. </p>
		<p>This device will wakeup regularly and announce the wakeup state by sending out a so called Wakeup Notification.
		The controller can then empty the mailbox. Therefore, the device needs to be configured with the desired wakeup 
		interval and the node ID of the controller. If the device was included by a static controller this 
		controller will usually perform all necessary configurations. The wakeup interval is a tradeoff between maximal 
		battery life time and the desired responses of the device. </p>
		</content><Wakeup>
	<p>The device will stay awake right after inclusion for 2.5 seconds allowing the controller to perform certain configuration actions. It is possible to manually wake up the device by pushing button 2 in management mode.</p>
	<p>The minimum allowed wakeup time is 240s but it is strongly recommended to define a much longer interval since the only purpose of a wakeup should be the reporting of the battery status or an update of the child protection settings. 
	Defining Node ID of 0 as a destination of the Wakeup Notification will disable the periodical wakeup function entirely.</p>
	</Wakeup><small><procontent>
		<p>It is possible to set the node ID to 255 to send wakeup notifications as broadcast. In this mode device takes more time to go 
		to sleep and drains battery faster, but can notify all it's direct neighbors about a wakeup. </p>
		</procontent></small><h3 class="chapterTitle">Node Information Frame</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">NI</span> The Node Information Frame is the business card of a Z-Wave device. It contains information about the device type and the technical
		capabilities. The inclusion and exclusion of the device is confirmed by sending out a Node Information Frame.  Beside this
		it may be needed for certain network operations to send out a Node Information Frame. </p>

<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">A</span> Z-Wave devices control other Z-Wave devices. The relationship between one device controlling another device is 
		called <i>association</i>. In order to control a different device, the controlling device needs to maintain a list of 
		devices that will receive controlling commands. These lists are called <b> association groups </b> and they are always 
		related to certain events (e.g. button pressed, sensor triggers, ...). In case the event happens all devices stored
		in the respective association group will receive a common wireless command. </p>

<h3 class="subchapterTitle">Set and unset associations to actuators</h3>
<content>
		<p>Associations can be assigned and remove either via Z-Wave commands or using the device itself.</p>
		<span class="icon_white">SA</span>
		</content><SetAssociation>	
	<p>To control a Z-Wave device from the Wall Controller the node ID of this devices needs to be assigned to one of the four 
	association groups. This is a three-step process:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Turn the Wall Controller into management mode and hit button 4 within 10 sec. (LED is blinking green when management 
	mode is reached).</li>
	<li>Within 10 sec. push the button you like the Z-Wave actuator to be assigned with. After 10 sec. the devices goes 
	back to sleep.  <b>Single click means adding to this association group, double click means removing the node selected </b>
	in step (3) from this association group.</li>
	<li>Find the Z-Wave actuator you like to control by the Wall Controller. Hit the button on the device to issue a Node 
	Information Frame within 20 sec. A common way is hitting a control button one or three times. 
	Please consult the manual of the device to be controlled for more information how to issue an Node Information Frame. 
	Any button press on Wall Controller at this stage will terminate the process.</li>
 	</ol>
	</SetAssociation><small></small><h3 class="chapterTitle">Configuration Parameters</h3>
<content>
		<p>Z-Wave products are supposed to work out of the box after inclusion, however certain configuration can adapt the

		<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Controllers may only allow to configure signed values. In order to set values in the range 128 … 255 the value 
		sent in the application shall be the desired value minus 256. For example: to set a parameter to 200  it may be needed to set
