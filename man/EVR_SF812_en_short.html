<h3 class="chapterTitle">Product description</h3>
<ProductDescription>The Smoke Detector SF812 uses a non-radioactive photo-sensor for a reliable and safe detection of smoke. Simply install the Smoke Detector on your ceiling and follow the procedure in the manual. 
Now your room is fitted with an early warning system against smoke. The smoke detector has a test button and a flashing led, so you always know that the smoke alarm is working correctly. 
The smoke alarm will warn you when the battery is low. When the device detects smoke, it will give a loud warning sound. It will also trigger actions in other Z-Wave devices or Z-Wave controllers to escalate the alarm. 
The Smoke Detector can also activate an alarm-scenario within the Z-Wave network. For example you can create an alarm-scenario to switch on all lights in the house when smoke is detected. 
Even at the middle of the night, you may leave the house very quickly when smoke is detected.</ProductDescription><h3 class="chapterTitle">Installation Guidelines</h3>
<Installation>
<img src="img/EVR/EVR_SF812/EVR_SF812_01_en.png" width="500" align="middle">
<ol>
 <li> Remove the mounting bracket from the detector by rotating it counterclockwise.</li> 
 <li> Dissolve the upper case from the lower case by rotating it in the oppsite direction and loosen the connector.</li>
 <li> Open the battery cover and connect the battery in the correct position.</li>
 <li> Fix the mounting bracket at a wall or a ceiling with the two screws.</li>
 <li> Link the connector to the clip in the correct position and reassemble the upper case with the lower case.</li>
 <li> Fix the device to the mounting bracket by rotating it clockwise.</li>
</ol>
<img src="img/EVR/EVR_SF812/EVR_SF812_02_en.png" width="700" align="middle">
<p>
Please follow the recommendations about amount as position of the sensor in your home as given above. Avoid
to place the sensor into the angle of walls, prefer positions in the middle of the room.</p>
</Installation><h3 class="chapterTitle">Behavior within the Z-Wave network</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">I</span> On factory default the device does not belong to any Z-Wave network. The device needs to join an existing 
		wireless network to communicate with the devices of this network. This process is called <b>Inclusion</b>. 
		Devices can also leave a network. This process is called  <b>Exclusion</b>. Both processes are initiated by the 
		primary controller of the Z-Wave network. This controller will be turned into exclusion respective inclusion mode. 
		Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion or exclusion mode. 
		Only if the primary controller is in inclusion or exclusion mode, this device can join or leave the network. 
		Leaving the network - i.e. being excluded - sets the device back to factory default.</p>
		<p>If the device already belongs to a network, follow the exclusion process before including it in your network.
		Otherwise inclusion of this device will fail. If the controller being included was a primary controller, it has to be reset 
		first.  
		</p>
		
		</content><InclusionExclusion>
<p>When the device is first time powered up it is not included in a Z-Wave network and has no Associations. The Siren will stay "awake" for 10 minutes when power is first applied to allow the configuration.</p>
<p>1. Inclusion: For Inclusion bring your Z-Wave controller in the relevant mode and click the inclusion/exclusion switch quickly 3 times. The LED is on when the switch is pressed.</p>
<p>2. Exclusion: For Exclusion bring your Z-Wave controller in the relevant mode and click the inclusion/exclusion switch quickly 3 times. The LED is on when the switch is pressed.</p>
<p>3. Reset: For Resetting click the inclusion/exclusion switch quickly 3 times to bring the device in the reset mode. Within 1 second, press the switch again until LED is off. 
The device now has factory settings.</p>
<p>4. Association: For Association bring your Z-Wave controller in the relevant mode and click the inclusion/exclusion switch quickly 3 times to bring it in the association mode. The device supports one association 
group with 5 nodes for Grouping 1.</p>
</InclusionExclusion><h3 class="chapterTitle">Operating the device</h3>
<Usage>
<p><ul>
<li>1. The detector sounds as long as the test button is pressed for 3 seconds or there is smoke in the detector. When the detector goes off, always check carefully to see that there is no fire 
and never remove the battery from the detector except when changing it!</li> 
<li>2. Always test the detector immediately after returning from holiday, after a longer period of absence or periodically to ensure the detector funtions normally. Under the test button, 
there is a red control LED which flashes once every 30 seconds. It indicates the detector is under normal operation. When the Smoke Detector senses smoke and simultaneously sounds an audible alarm, the red
LED will flash fast. If the detector does not sound when testing, the battery must be replaced.</li>
<li>3. Never use an open flame to test your detector. You may set fire to damage the detector, as well as your home.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</Usage><h3 class="chapterTitle">Wakeup Intervals - how to communicate with the device?</h3>
<content>
 		<p><span class="icon_white">W</span> This device is battery operated and turned into deep sleep state most of the time to save battery life time.  
 		Communication with the device is limited. In order to communicate with the device, a static controller <b>C</b>
 		is needed in the network. This controller will maintain a mailbox for the battery operated devices and store 
 		commands that can not be received during deep sleep state.
		Without such a controller, communication may become impossible and/or the battery life time is significantly decreased. </p>
		<p>This device will wakeup regularly and announce the wakeup state by sending out a so called Wakeup Notification.
		The controller can then empty the mailbox. Therefore, the device needs to be configured with the desired wakeup 
		interval and the node ID of the controller. If the device was included by a static controller this 
		controller will usually perform all necessary configurations. The wakeup interval is a tradeoff between maximal 
		battery life time and the desired responses of the device. </p>
		</content><Wakeup>
	<p>Tripple click on the inclusion/exclusion button will wake up the device and keep it awake for 5 seconds.</p>
</Wakeup><small><procontent>
		<p>It is possible to set the node ID to 255 to send wakeup notifications as broadcast. In this mode device takes more time to go 
		to sleep and drains battery faster, but can notify all it's direct neighbors about a wakeup. </p>
		</procontent></small><h3 class="chapterTitle">Node Information Frame</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">NI</span> The Node Information Frame is the business card of a Z-Wave device. It contains information about the device type and the technical
		capabilities. The inclusion and exclusion of the device is confirmed by sending out a Node Information Frame.  Beside this
		it may be needed for certain network operations to send out a Node Information Frame. </p>
		</content><NIF>
<p>Hitting the inclusion/exclusion button three times will send out an Node Information Frame.</p>
</NIF><h3 class="chapterTitle">Associations</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">A</span> Z-Wave devices control other Z-Wave devices. The relationship between one device controlling another device is 
		called <i>association</i>. In order to control a different device, the controlling device needs to maintain a list of 
		devices that will receive controlling commands. These lists are called <b> association groups </b> and they are always 
		related to certain events (e.g. button pressed, sensor triggers, ...). In case the event happens all devices stored
		in the respective association group will receive a common wireless command. </p>
