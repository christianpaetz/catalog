<ProductDescription>
<p>The TZ66-S single wall switch is switching attached loads and is controlled either by the local switching paddle or remotely via the Z-Wave wireless protocol. 
It is included and controlled in a Z-Wave network by a remote control, a wireless control centre or any other kind of Z-Wave controller including a PC-software. 
Beside the local switch the unit can control other Z-Wave units remotely in up to three additional Z-Wave groups, which are associated with this device. Tipping 
one time or two times the switching paddle performs the control. The association of further Z-Wave devices needs to be done by a Z-Wave controller. The unit is 
powered by 230V power and needs a pattress box with 230 V power wires for installation.</p>
<p>The unit is shipped completely with electronics, switching paddle and mounting frame in arctic white HomePro style, which can be replaced by another mounting 
frame of the HomePro switching series. The unit is designed for use within a 3-wire system, which means that a neutral wire (blue) is needed for operations.</p>
<div>
<strong>Attention:</strong> The Switch does not fit in a german 60mm pattress box!</div>
</ProductDescription><h3 class="chapterTitle">Installation Guidelines</h3>
<Installation>
		<p> The TZ66-S wall mounted switch needs a pattress box with 230 V power wires for installation. It does not fit into German wall boxes with 60 mm diameter.</p> 
		<ol> 
		<li> To install the wall switch first remove the paddle using a small screw driver.</li> 
		<li> Afterwards remove the four screws through the retaining ring holding the trim ring to the mounting plate. This will allow the removal of the trim ring. 
			When removing the trim ring make sure not to bend or disrupt the shape of the antenna wire.</li>
		<li> Wire the product according to the schematics. The two wired from the mains distribution panel are directly connected to the inserts contacts <b>N</b> 
			and <b>L</b>. The contact <b>L'</b> is the switched load output and needs to be connected to the cable of the load.</li>
		<li> Install the product in the wall box.</li>
		<li> Reinstall the trim ring and the retaining ring with the four screws. Mind the arrow on the inserts top side showing the mounting direction of the insert.</li>
		<li> Return the switching paddle by pushing it into the mounting frame. Make sure the LED window is also towards the stamped word "Bottom" on the retaining
			ring.</li>

 	</Installation><h3 class="chapterTitle">Behavior within the Z-Wave network</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">I</span> On factory default the device does not belong to any Z-Wave network. The device needs to join an existing 
		wireless network to communicate with the devices of this network. This process is called <b>Inclusion</b>. 
		Devices can also leave a network. This process is called  <b>Exclusion</b>. Both processes are initiated by the 
		primary controller of the Z-Wave network. This controller will be turned into exclusion respective inclusion mode. 
		Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion or exclusion mode. 
		Only if the primary controller is in inclusion or exclusion mode, this device can join or leave the network. 
		Leaving the network - i.e. being excluded - sets the device back to factory default.</p>
		<p>If the device already belongs to a network, follow the exclusion process before including it in your network.
		Otherwise inclusion of this device will fail. If the controller being included was a primary controller, it has to be reset 
		first.  
		</p>
		
		</content><InclusionExclusion>
 		<p> To include the device into a controllers Z-Wave network first setup the controller you are using into inclusion mode. Afterwards tap either the top 
		or bottom of the switch once.</p>
 		<p> The device is excluded by a single click on the switch when the controller is in exclusion mode.</p>
	</InclusionExclusion><h3 class="chapterTitle">Operating the device</h3>
<Usage>
 		<p> The actuator is operated by the local switching paddle or wirelessly using Z-Wave commands. If the insert is mounted correctly	
		pushing the upper part of the paddle will turn ON the load. Pushing the lower part of the paddle will turn OFF the electric load. 
		Pressing and holding the switch will allow dimming and brightening of Z-Wave dimmers if associated.</p>
		<p> The device is also able to report status changes to a controller (communication pattern 2) and to remotely operate other devices 
		 by sending wireless Z-Wave commands. As part of a Z-Wave network, the TZ66-S will also act as a wireless repeater to insure that commands intended 
		 for another devices in the network are received.</p>
	</Usage><h3 class="chapterTitle">LED Control</h3>
<LEDControl>
	<ul>
	<li>The LED on the TZ66-S will turn on when the load attached is off, to act as a night light. However, the LED can be user configured to turn 
	on when the load attached is on.</li>
	<li>The TZ66-S will flicker its LED when it is transmitting to any of its 3 groups. This can be changed if desired. See "LED transmission indication".</li>
	</ul>
	</LEDControl><h3 class="chapterTitle">Associations</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">A</span> Z-Wave devices control other Z-Wave devices. The relationship between one device controlling another device is 
		called <i>association</i>. In order to control a different device, the controlling device needs to maintain a list of 
		devices that will receive controlling commands. These lists are called <b> association groups </b> and they are always 
		related to certain events (e.g. button pressed, sensor triggers, ...). In case the event happens all devices stored
		in the respective association group will receive a common wireless command. </p>			
		<p>Association Groups:</p>

<td>1</td>
<td>every switching command

</tr></table></p>
<p></p>
<h3 class="chapterTitle">Configuration Parameters</h3>
<content>
		<p>Z-Wave products are supposed to work out of the box after inclusion, however certain configuration can adapt the 
		function better to user needs or unlock further enhanced features.</p>
		<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Controllers may only allow to configure signed values. In order to set values in the range 128 … 255 the value 
		sent in the application shall be the desired value minus 256. For example: to set a parameter to 200  it may be needed to set 
		a value of 200 minus 256 =  minus 56. In case of two byte value the same logic applies: Values greater than 32768 may 
		needed to be given as negative values too.</p>
