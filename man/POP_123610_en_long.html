<h3 class="chapterTitle">What is Z-Wave?</h3>
<content>
			<p>This device is equipped with wireless communication complying to the Z-Wave standard. 
			Z-Wave is the <b>international standard for wireless communication</b> in smart homes and buildings. 
			It is using the <b>frequency of 868.42 MHz</b> to realize a very stable and secure communication. 
			Each message is reconfirmed (<b>two-way communication</b>) and every mains powered node can act as a 
			repeater for other nodes (<b>meshed network</b>) in case the receiver is not in direct wireless 
			range of the transmitter.</p>
			
			<p>Z-Wave differentiates between Controllers and Slaves. Slaves are either sensors 
			<b>(S)</b> transmitting metered or measured data or actuators <b>(A)</b> capable to execute an action.
			Controllers are either static mains powered controllers <b>(C)</b> also referred to as gateways or mobile battery
			operated remote controls <b>(R)</b>.
			This results in a number of possible communication patterns within a Z-Wave network that are  partly 
			or completely supported by a specific device.</p>
			<img src="img/zoverview.png" width="250" align="right">
			<ol>
			<li> Controllers control actuators </li>
			<li> Actuators report change of status back to controller </li>
			<li> Sensors report change of status of measured values to controller </li>
			<li> Sensors directly control actuators </li>
			<li> Actuators control other actuators </li>
			<li> Remote controls send signals to static controllers to trigger scenes or other actions </li>	
			<li> Remote controls control other actuators. </li>			
			</ol>
 		</content><small><procontent>
		<p>There are two different role a controller can have. There is always one single primary controller that is managing
		the network and including/excluding devices. The controller may have other functions - like control buttons - as well.
		All other controllers don't manage the network itself but can control other devices. They are called secondary controllers.
		The image also shows that its not possible to operate a sensor just from a remote control. Sensors only communicate
		with static controllers.</p>
		</procontent></small><h3 class="chapterTitle">Product description</h3>
<ProductDescription>
<p>This is a switch plug that can be placed between a standard Schuko (Type F) wall outlet and 
electric devices, plugged in by cord. It can switch all electrical loads up to 3500 W. The 
device is IP 20 rated and can therefore only be used on dry environments. Switching is controlled 
wirelessly using Z-Wave or locally using a toggleing button. A blue LED indicates the switching status.
An automatic 'Off' function and programmable switching behavior make the device a very flexible tool 
for the inhouse lighting.</p>
</ProductDescription><h3 class="chapterTitle">Before Device is installed</h3>
<content>
		<p>Please read carefully the enclosed user manual before installation of the radio-actuator, in 
		order to ensure an error-free functioning.</p>
		<p> ATTENTION: only authorized technicians under consideration of the country-specific installation 
		guidelines/norms may do works with 230 Volt mains power. Prior to the assembly of the product, the voltage 
		network has to be switched off and ensured against re-switching.</p>
		<p> The product is permitted only for proper use as specified in the user manual. Any kind of guarantee claim has 
		to be forfeited if changes, modifications or painting are undertaken. The product must be checked for damages 
		immediately after unpacking. In the case of damages, the product must not be operated in any case.
		If a danger-free operation of the equipment cannot be assured, the voltage supply has to be interrupted 
		 immediately and the equipment has to be protected from unintended operation.</p>	
		</content><h3 class="chapterTitle">Installation Guidelines</h3>
<Installation>
<p>The plug can be plugged into every wall outlet for Plug-Type Schuko. 
It is IP20 rated and can therefore only be used in dry environments. Do not locate the device facing 
direct sunlight, humid or dusty place. The suitable ambient temperature for the device is 0°C ~ 40°C.  
Plugs must not be stacked and operated.</p> 
</Installation><h3 class="chapterTitle">Behavior within the Z-Wave network</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">I</span> On factory default the device does not belong to any Z-Wave network. The device needs to join an existing 
		wireless network to communicate with the devices of this network. This process is called <b>Inclusion</b>. 
		Devices can also leave a network. This process is called  <b>Exclusion</b>. Both processes are initiated by the 
		primary controller of the Z-Wave network. This controller will be turned into exclusion respective inclusion mode. 
		Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion or exclusion mode. 
		Only if the primary controller is in inclusion or exclusion mode, this device can join or leave the network. 
		Leaving the network - i.e. being excluded - sets the device back to factory default.</p>
		<p>If the device already belongs to a network, follow the exclusion process before including it in your network.
		Otherwise inclusion of this device will fail. If the controller being included was a primary controller, it has to be reset 
		first.  
		</p>
		
		</content><InclusionExclusion>
<p>Inclusion and Exclusion are confirmed by a tripple click on the button. </p>
</InclusionExclusion><h3 class="chapterTitle">Operating the device</h3>
<Usage>
<p align="center"><img src="img/POP/PLUGS/POP_123580_op_en.png" width="200" align="middle"> </p>
<p>The device is able to switch electric loads up to 3500 W and can be switched wirelessly 
or using the local button.</p>
<p><b> Local Operation</b><br>
The local button allowes to switch the device. A short press on the button toggles the switch. If 
it is in on state the button turns off and respective in off state the button turns on.</p>
<p><b> LED Usage</b><br>
The device has one blue LED used to indicate status information. The behavior
of the blue LED can be configured:
<ul>
<li> It may show the switching state. This is the default option.</li>
<li> It may serve as night light. So it is on when the light is off.</li>
<li> It is deactivated.</li>
<li> It can be controlled wirelessly and used as an indicator for other advanced functions.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b> Automated Switch-Off Function </b> <br>
If activated the switch will turn off automatically after a defined time. This function is particularly useful if the switch is
turned on using a motion detector of any other type of sensor. In this case it is possible to further define the reaction of the switch
on certain signals sent from a sensor. This allowes a very flexible application of the plug switch in the house.
</p>
</Usage><h3 class="chapterTitle">Child Protection</h3>
<content>
		<p> The device can be turn into a child protection mode. In this mode all local operation is disabled.</p> 
		</content><Protection>
<p>The child protection mode MUST be turned on wirelessly. However in protected by sequence mode it is possible to unlock the device for local 
operation with a triple click. The unlock state will last for 5 seconds.</p>
</Protection><h3 class="chapterTitle">Associations</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">A</span> Z-Wave devices control other Z-Wave devices. The relationship between one device controlling another device is 
		called <i>association</i>. In order to control a different device, the controlling device needs to maintain a list of 
		devices that will receive controlling commands. These lists are called <b> association groups </b> and they are always 
		related to certain events (e.g. button pressed, sensor triggers, ...). In case the event happens all devices stored
		in the respective association group will receive a common wireless command. </p>			
		<p>Association Groups:</p>

<p></p>
<h3 class="chapterTitle">Configuration Parameters</h3>
<content>
		<p>Z-Wave products are supposed to work out of the box after inclusion, however certain configuration can adapt the 
		function better to user needs or unlock further enhanced features.</p>
		<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Controllers may only allow to configure signed values. In order to set values in the range 128 … 255 the value 
		sent in the application shall be the desired value minus 256. For example: to set a parameter to 200  it may be needed to set 
		a value of 200 minus 256 =  minus 56. In case of two byte value the same logic applies: Values greater than 32768 may 
		needed to be given as negative values too.</p>
