<h3 class="chapterTitle">What is Z-Wave?</h3>
<content>
			<p>This device is equipped with wireless communication complying to the Z-Wave standard. 
			Z-Wave is the <b>international standard for wireless communication</b> in smart homes and buildings. 
			It is using the <b>frequency of 868.42 MHz</b> to realize a very stable and secure communication. 
			Each message is reconfirmed (<b>two-way communication</b>) and every mains powered node can act as a 
			repeater for other nodes (<b>meshed network</b>) in case the receiver is not in direct wireless 
			range of the transmitter.</p>
			
			<p>Z-Wave differentiates between Controllers and Slaves. Slaves are either sensors 
			<b>(S)</b> transmitting metered or measured data or actuators <b>(A)</b> capable to execute an action.
			Controllers are either static mains powered controllers <b>(C)</b> also referred to as gateways or mobile battery
			operated remote controls <b>(R)</b>.
			This results in a number of possible communication patterns within a Z-Wave network that are  partly 
			or completely supported by a specific device.</p>
			<img src="img/zoverview.png" width="250" align="right">
			<ol>
			<li> Controllers control actuators </li>
			<li> Actuators report change of status back to controller </li>
			<li> Sensors report change of status of measured values to controller </li>
			<li> Sensors directly control actuators </li>
			<li> Actuators control other actuators </li>
			<li> Remote controls send signals to static controllers to trigger scenes or other actions </li>	
			<li> Remote controls control other actuators. </li>			
			</ol>
 		</content><small><procontent>
		<p>There are two different role a controller can have. There is always one single primary controller that is managing
		the network and including/excluding devices. The controller may have other functions - like control buttons - as well.
		All other controllers don't manage the network itself but can control other devices. They are called secondary controllers.
		The image also shows that its not possible to operate a sensor just from a remote control. Sensors only communicate
		with static controllers.</p>

<ProductDescription>
<p>The ZM1702 is a Z-Wave controllable door lock that fits into standard European doors. 
The mechanics can be adopted to right or left opening doors. The door lock can be applied for 
doors from a thickness of 38 mm and up. Since the lock is just a single dead bold lock it 
will not replace modern three dead bold locking outer doors. The door can be locked and 
unlocked using the inner side turn piece and/or the key pad. The wireless control allows 
to lock/unlock the lock, set/unset up to 15 different key codes (4...8 key long) and to 
limit the validity of certain key code.
</p>
<p> Note: The distance between the center of the handle axle and the center of the key 
insert is 88 mm. If the lock shall be used to retrofit an existing door, the original handle
lock distance needs ot be similar.
</p>
<p><b>Scope of Delivery:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>inner plate with handle and turn piece</li>
<li>outer plate with handle and key pad</li>
<li>inner lock mechanics</li>
<li>cylinder with 3 keys</li>
</ul>
</ProductDescription><h3 class="chapterTitle">Batteries</h3>
<content>
			<p>The unit is operated by batteries. Use only batteries of correct type. Never mix old and new batteries 
			in the same device. Used batteries contain hazardous substances and should not be disposed of 
			with household waste!</p>
		</content><p>Battery Type: 
				4  * AA</p>

<p><b>Change Orientation of the Handle</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the Retaining Ring on both handles and remove the metal plate.<br>

</li>
<li>If handle is on the left hand side (seen from outer door side) place the spring and

</li>
<li>If you want the handle on the right hand side (seen from the outer door side), place the spring and the metal plate like below.
Apply the retaining ring again.<br><img src="img/VIS/1702_3.png" width="500" align="middle"> </li>
<li>If needed change the latchbolt direction as described in the manual supplied with the product.

</ul>
</Installation><h3 class="chapterTitle">Behavior within the Z-Wave network</h3>
<content>
		<p><span class="icon_white">I</span> On factory default the device does not belong to any Z-Wave network. The device needs to join an existing 
		wireless network to communicate with the devices of this network. This process is called <b>Inclusion</b>. 
		Devices can also leave a network. This process is called  <b>Exclusion</b>. Both processes are initiated by the 
		primary controller of the Z-Wave network. This controller will be turned into exclusion respective inclusion mode. 
		Please refer to your primary controllers manual on how to turn your controller into inclusion or exclusion mode. 
		Only if the primary controller is in inclusion or exclusion mode, this device can join or leave the network. 
		Leaving the network - i.e. being excluded - sets the device back to factory default.</p>
		<p>If the device already belongs to a network, follow the exclusion process before including it in your network.
		Otherwise inclusion of this device will fail. If the controller being included was a primary controller, it has to be reset 
		first.  
		</p>
		
		</content><InclusionExclusion>
<p>To confirm Inclusion and Exclusion insert the following Key sequence on the key 
pad: 'C' + '8' + '8' + '8' followed by turning the handle on the inside of the door lock.
The operation is confirmed by a long beep.</p>
